	abstract = {The {CXC} chemokine {CXCL}12 is an important factor in physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and inflammation, because it activates and/or induces migration of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, endothelial cells and most leukocytes. Therefore, {CXCL}12 activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels. {CXCL}12 has the unique property of existing in six splice variants in humans, each having a specific tissue distribution and in vivo activity. Controlled splice variant transcription and {mRNA} stability determine the {CXCL}12 expression profile. {CXCL}12 fulfills its functions in homeostatic and pathological conditions by interacting with its receptors {CXC} chemokine receptor 4 ({CXCR}4) and atypical chemokine receptor 3 ({ACKR}3) and by binding to glycosaminoglycans ({GAGs}) in tissues and on the endothelium to allow a proper presentation to passing leukocytes. Homodimerizaton and heterodimerization of {CXCL}12 and its receptors can alter their signaling activity, as exemplified by the synergy between {CXCL}12 and other chemokines in leukocyte migration assays. Receptor binding may also initiate {CXCL}12 internalization and its subsequent removal from the environment. Furthermore, {CXCL}12 activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications. Proteolytic removal of {NH}2- or {COOH}-terminal amino acids, citrullination of arginine residues by peptidyl arginine deiminases or nitration of tyrosine residues reduce {CXCL}12 activity. This review summarizes the interactions of {CXCL}12 with the cellular environment and discusses the different levels of {CXCL}12 activity regulation.},

Here, we show that mice lacking the key enzyme to generate {GCs}, {UDPgalactose}:ceramide galactosyltransferase ({CGTϪ}/Ϫ), exhibit severe postnatal atrophy of all lymphoid organs, owing to a maturational arrest before the {proB}/T cell stage. This lineage-specific defect originates from the bone marrow ({BM}) stroma since it is not transplantable to irradiated wild-type recipients. Remarkably, {CGTϪ}/Ϫ long-term B lymphoid {BM} cultures displayed severe deficits in the number of {CD}45negVCAM-1pos stromal cells and fibronectin matrix assembly, and produced floating macrophages rather than B lymphocytes. The fibronectin network was also altered in the {CGT}-deficient {BM} parenchyma. These results point to an essential role for galactolipids in the formation of fibronectin-enriched lymphoid-specific stromal niches in the {BM}.},

	abstract = {Pain is associated with most bony pathologies. Clinical and experimental observations suggest that bone pain can be derived from noxious stimulation of the periosteum or bone marrow. Sensory neurons are known to innervate the periosteum and marrow cavity, and most of these have a morphology and molecular phenotype consistent with a role in nociception. However, little is known about the physiology of these neurons, and therefore information about mechanisms that generate and maintain bone pain is lacking. The periosteum has received greater attention relative to the bone marrow, reflecting the easier access of the periosteum for experimental assessment. With the electrophysiological preparations used, investigators have been able to record from single periosteal units in isolation, and there is a lot of information available about how they respond to different stimuli, including those that are noxious. In contrast, preparations used to study sensory neurons that innervate the bone marrow have been limited to recording multi-unit activity in whole nerves, and whilst they clearly report responses to noxious stimulation, it is not possible to define responses for single sensory neurons that innervate the bone marrow. There is only limited evidence that peripheral sensory neurons that innervate bone can be sensitized or that they can be activated by multiple stimulus types, and at present this only exists in part for periosteal units. In the central nervous system, it is clear that spinal dorsal horn neurons can be activated by noxious stimuli applied to bone. Some can be sensitized under pathological conditions and may contribute in part to secondary or referred pain associated with bony pathology. Activity related to stimulation of sensory nerves that innervate bone has also been reported in neurons of the spinoparabrachial pathway and the somatosensory cortices, both known for roles in coding information about pain. Whilst these provide some clues as to the way information about bone pain is centrally coded, they need to be expanded to further our understanding of other central territories involved. There is a lot more to learn about the physiology of peripheral sensory neurons that innervate bone and their central projections.},

	abstract = {The innervation of bone has been described for centuries, and our understanding of its function has rapidly evolved over the past several decades to encompass roles of subtype‐specific neurons in skeletal homeostasis. Current research has been largely focused on the distribution and function of specific neuronal populations within bone, as well as their cellular and molecular relationships with target cells in the bone microenvironment. This review provides a historical perspective of the field of skeletal neurobiology that highlights the diverse yet interconnected nature of nerves and skeletal health, particularly in the context of bone anabolism and pain. We explore what is known regarding the neuronal subtypes found in the skeleton, their distribution within bone compartments, and their central projection pathways. This neuroskeletal map then serves as a foundation for a comprehensive discussion of the neural control of skeletal development, homeostasis, repair, and bone pain. Active synthesis of this research recently led to the first biotherapeutic success story in the field. Specifically, the ongoing clinical trials of anti‐nerve growth factor therapeutics have been optimized to titrated doses that effectively alleviate pain while maintaining bone and joint health. Continued collaborations between neuroscientists and bone biologists are needed to build on this progress, leading to a more complete understanding of neural regulation of the skeleton and development of novel therapeutics. © 2019 The Authors.

Although our knowledge of skeletal sensory and sympathetic innervation is incomplete, including the specific locations and subtypes of nerves in bone, we are now able to reconcile early studies utilizing denervation models with recent work dissecting the molecular signaling between bone and nerve. In total, sensory innervation functions in bone much as it does elsewhere in the body—to sense and respond to stimuli, including mechanical loading. Similarly, sympathetic nerves regulate autonomic functions related to bone, including homeostatic remodeling and vascular tone. However, more study is required to translate our current knowledge of bone-nerve crosstalk to novel therapeutic strategies that can be effectively utilized to combat skeletal diseases, disorders of low bone mass, and age-related decreases in bone quality.},

	abstract = {Skeletal diseases and their surgical treatment induce severe pain. The innervation density of bone potentially explains the severe pain reported. Animal studies concluded that sensory myelinated A∂-fibers and unmyelinated C-fibers are mainly responsible for conducting bone pain, and that the innervation density of these nerve fibers was highest in periosteum. However, literature regarding sensory innervation of human bone is scarce. This observational study aimed to quantify sensory nerve fiber density in periosteum, cortical bone, and bone marrow of axial and appendicular human bones using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that the total number of sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers was highest in periosteum, followed by bone marrow, and cortical bone for all bones studied. Bone from thoracic vertebral bodies contained most sensory nerve fibers, followed by the upper extremity, lower extremity, and parietal neurocranium. The number of nerve fibers declined with age and did not differ between male and female specimens. Sensory nerve fibers were organized as a branched network throughout the periosteum. The current results provide an explanation for the severe pain accompanying skeletal disease, fracture, or surgery. Further, the results could provide more insight into mechanisms that generate and maintain skeletal pain and might aid in developing new treatment strategies.
Perspective
This article presents the innervation of human bone and assesses the effect of age, gender, bone compartment and type of bone on innervation density. The presented data provide an explanation for the severity of bone pain arising from skeletal diseases and their surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {To coordinate specialized organs, inter-tissue communication appeared during evolution. Consequently, individual organs communicate their states via a vast interorgan communication network ({ICN}) made up of peptides, proteins, and metabolites that act between organs to coordinate cellular processes under homeostasis and stress. However, the nature of the interorgan signaling could be even more complex and involve mobilization mechanisms of unconventional cells that are still poorly described. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ({MSCs}) virtually reside in all tissues, though the biggest reservoir discovered so far is adipose tissue where they are named adipose stromal cells ({ASCs}). {MSCs} are thought to participate in tissue maintenance and repair since the administration of exogenous {MSCs} is well known to exert beneficial effects under several pathological conditions. However, the role of endogenous {MSCs} is barely understood. Though largely debated, the presence of circulating endogenous {MSCs} has been reported in multiple pathophysiological conditions, but the significance of such cell circulation is not known and therapeutically untapped. In this review, we discuss current knowledge on the circulation of native {MSCs}, and we highlight recent findings describing {MSCs} as putative key components of the {ICN}.},

	abstract = {Santiago Ramón y Cajal described a number of somatosensory structures, including several associated with pain, in his major work on the Histology of the Nervous System of Man and Vertebrates. Our knowledge of such structures has been considerably expanded since Cajal because of the introduction of a number of experimental approaches that were not available in his time. For example, Cajal made several drawings of peripheral mechanoreceptors, as well as of bare nerve endings, but later work by others described additional somatosensory receptors and investigated the ultrastructure of bare nerve endings. Furthermore, the transducer molecules responsible for responses to nociceptive, thermal or chemical stimuli are now becoming known, including a series of {TRP} (transient receptor potential) receptor molecules, such as {TRPV}1 (the capsaicin receptor). Cajal described the development of dorsal root and other sensory ganglion cells and related the disposition of their somata and neurites to his theory of the functional polarity of neurons. He described the entry of both large and small afferent fibers into the spinal cord, including the projections of their collaterals into different parts of the gray matter and into different white matter tracts. He described a number of types of neurons in the gray matter, including ones in the marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa and head and neck of the dorsal horn. He found neurons in the deep dorsal horn whose dendrites extend dorsally into the superficial dorsal horn. Some of these neurons have since been shown by retrograde labeling to be spinothalamic tract cells. Cajal clearly described the dorsal column/medial lemniscus pathway, but the presence and course of the spinothalamic tract was unknown at the time.},

Indeed, {SCI} causes excessive proliferation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPC}), but these cells cannot leave the bone marrow, even after challenging the host with a potent inflammatory stimulus. Sequestration of {HSPCs} in bone marrow after {SCI} is linked to aberrant chemotactic signaling that can be reversed by post-injury injections of Plerixafor ({AMD}3100), a small molecule inhibitor of {CXCR}4. Even though Plerixafor liberates {HSPCs} and mature immune cells from bone marrow, competitive repopulation assays show that the intrinsic long-term functional capacity of {HSPCs} is still impaired in {SCI} mice. Together, our data suggest that {SCI} causes an acquired bone marrow failure syndrome that may contribute to chronic immune dysfunction.},

The bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell niche defines a location within the marrow in which mesenchymal stem cells are retained and produce new cells throughout life. Deciphering the signaling mechanisms by which the niche regulates stem cell fate will facilitate the use of these cells for therapy. Recent studies, by using state-of-the-art methodologies, including sophisticated in vivo inducible genetic techniques, such as lineage-tracing Cre/{loxP} mediated systems, in combination with pharmacological inhibition, provide evidence that sensory neuron is an important component of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell niche. Strikingly, knockout of a specific receptor in sensory neurons blocked stem cell function in the bone marrow. The knowledge arising from these discoveries will be crucial for stem cell manipulation in the future. Here, we review recent progress in our understanding of sensory nerves biology in the stem cell niche.},

Neutrophils also participate as mediators of inflammation. The classical view for these leukocytes is that neutrophils constitute a homogenous population of terminally differentiated cells with a unique function. However, evidence accumulated in recent years, has revealed that neutrophils present a large phenotypic heterogeneity and functional versatility, which place neutrophils as important modulators of both inflammation and immune responses. Indeed, the roles played by neutrophils in homeostatic conditions as well as in pathological inflammation and immune processes are the focus of a renovated interest in neutrophil biology. In this review, I present the concept of neutrophil phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and describe several neutrophil subpopulations reported to date.

	abstract = {Neutrophils play an essential role in immune defenses because they ingest, kill, and digest invading microorganisms, including fungi and bacteria. Failure to carry out this role leads to immunodeficiency, which is mainly characterized by the presence of recurrent infections. Defects in neutrophil function can be quantitative, as seen in neutropenia or qualitative, as seen in neutrophil dysfunction. The standard circulating neutrophil count is above 1.5 x 10/L. Neutropenia can be classified in asymptomatic (mild), moderate, and severe, and thus, the progression to infection concerning the number. Neutropenia, with decreased production with marrow hypoplasia, can be primary and due to chronic benign neutropenia, cyclical neutropenia, and other congenital and familial neutropenias. It can be secondary to cytotoxic drugs, aplastic anemia, leukemia, drug reactions, and infections. Neutropenia, with increased destruction with marrow hyperplasia, is due to hypersplenism and immune neutropenia. Secondary causes are the commonest. For example, neutropenia caused as a side effect of chemotherapy for malignancies. Congenital forms are rare and vary in severity; some of them are life-threatening conditions including leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, hyper-{IgE}, recurrent infection syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease.},

Currently, clozapine is used for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, with mandatory blood count monitoring for the duration of treatment. Agranulocytosis occurs in up to 0.8\% of patients and presents a significant medical challenge, despite decreasing mortality rates. In this paper, we review the epidemiology of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis ({CLIA}), advances in identifying genetic risk factors, and the preventive measures to reduce the risk of {CLIA}. We discuss the pathogenesis of {CLIA}, which, despite receiving considerable scientific attention, has not been fully elucidated. Finally, we address the clinical management and suggest the approach to clozapine re-challenge in patients with a previous episode of neutropenia. With a significant proportion of clozapine recipients in Western hemisphere being Black, we comment on the importance of recognizing benign ethnic neutropenia as a potential impediment to clozapine administration. This review aims to aid haematologists and psychiatrists to jointly manage neutropenia and agranulocytosis caused by clozapine.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: For the normal resolution of an acute inflammatory response, neutrophil ({PMN}) apoptosis is essential to maintain immune homeostasis and to limit inappropriate host tissue damage. A delay in {PMN} apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({SIRS}). Dopamine, a biogenic amine with known cardiovascular and neurotransmitter properties, is used in patients with {SIRS} to maintain hemodynamic stability. We sought to determine whether dopamine may also have immunoregulatory properties capable of influencing {PMN} apoptosis, function, and activation state in patients with {SIRS}.
{METHODS}: {PMNs} were isolated from healthy volunteers and patients with {SIRS} and treated with varying doses of dopamine and a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam. {PMN} apoptosis was assessed every 6 hours with use of propidium iodide {DNA} staining and {PMN} function was assessed with use of respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis ability, and {CD}11a, {CD}11b, and {CD}18 receptor expression as functional markers.
{RESULTS}: There was a significant delay in {PMN} apotosis in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment of isolated {PMNs} from both healthy controls and patients with {SIRS} with 10 and 100 mumol/L dopamine induced apoptosis. {PMN} ingestive and cytocidal capacity were both decreased in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment with dopamine significantly increased phagocytic function. Fenoldopam did not induce {PMN} apoptosis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data demonstrate for the first time that dopamine induces {PMN} apoptosis and modulates {PMN} function both in healthy controls and in patients with {SIRS}. These results indicate that dopamine may be beneficial during {SIRS} through a nonhemodynamic {PMN}-dependent proapoptotic mechanism.},

All {FEP} patients were assessed with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PANSS}) and the Clinician Global Impression-Severity ({CGI}-S) scores. Verbal memory and executive functions were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Prevailing emotional state was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-{II} and Beck Anxiety Inventory. 27 eligible subjects screened out of 79 consecutive {FEP} patients with their age-/sex-matched controls were recruited. The {FEP} patients had an {NLR} of 1.886 higher than controls after accounting for emotional states. The {NLR} of {FEP} patients was positively associated with {PANSS} positive symptom, disorganization and excitation scores, as well as {CGI}-S scores. There was no significant correlation between {NLR} with duration of untreated psychosis and cognitive performances. These findings support using {NLR} as clinical biomarker in {FEP}, purporting further prospective study to measure {NLR} changes in the course of treatment.},

In addition, the study aimed to investigate the relationship between {NLR} and disease severity and some metabolic/inflammatory parameters.Methods: Fifty-two patients diagnosed with schzophrenia and 53 healthy controls were included in the study. A socio-demographic information form was filled out by the clinician. Height, body weight, waist and hip circumference and blood pressure values of each patient were measured. Severity of disease was assessed by positive and negative syndrome scale ({PANSS}) and clinical global impression-severity scale ({CGI}-S). Complete blood count was performed to both patient and control groups. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, {HbA}1c, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), triglyceride, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) were measured.Results: The number of leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and {NLR} values in patients with schizophrenia was significantly higher than in the control group. There was no significant relationship between {NLR} values and the number of hospitalisation, duration of ilness or disease severity in patients. There was no correlation between other laboratory findings and {NLR} values.Conclusion: {NLR} levels are high in schizophrenia independent of metabolic parameters according to the results.

Here we investigated the effects of 10 phenothiazine compounds on {NOX} activity using an extensive panel of assays to measure production of {ROS} (Amplex red, {WST}-1, {MCLA}) and oxygen consumption. Striking differences between highly similar phenothiazines were observed. Two phenothiazines without N-substitution, including {ML}171, did not inhibit {NOX} enzymes, but showed assay interference. Introduction of an aliphatic amine chain on the N atom of the phenothiazine B ring (promazine) conferred inhibitory activity toward {NOX}2, {NOX}4, and {NOX}5 but not {NOX}1 and {NOX}3. Addition of an electron-attracting substituent in position 2 of the C ring extended the inhibitory activity to {NOX}1 and {NOX}3, with thioridazine being the most potent inhibitor. In contrast, the presence of a methylsulfoxide group at the same position (mesoridazine) entirely abolished {NOXinhibitory} activity. A cell-free {NOX}2 assay suggested that inhibition by N-substituted phenothiazines was not due to competition with {NADPH}. A functional implication of {NOX}-inhibitory activity of thioridazine was demonstrated by its ability to block redox-dependent myoﬁbroblast differentiation. Our results demonstrate that {NOX}-inhibitory activity is not a common feature of all antipsychotic phenothiazines and that substitution on the B-ring nitrogen is crucial for the activity, whereas that on the second position of the C ring modulates it. Our ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of {NOX} pharmacology and might pave the path to discovery of more potent and selective {NOX} inhibitors.},

	shorttitle = {Is Elevated Neutrophil Count and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio a Cause or Consequence of Schizophrenia?},
	abstract = {Background: Several studies have found an association between elevated neutrophil count or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) in peripheral blood from patients with schizophrenia. The etiology behind this effect is unknown, and it is unclear if changes in neutrophil count and {NLR} may be induced by antipsychotics or if these parameters relate to the diagnosis and symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of this scoping review was to map research that explores this association, and to identify gaps in the current knowledge base.
Method: The work was conducted in accordance with established methodological standards for scoping reviews. Studies on neutrophil count and {NLR} in schizophrenia were identified through search in relevant databases, and a parallel screening procedure was performed to ensure validity and reproducibility of the search. Articles that included different comparison groups, with differences in medication status (drug-naïve or drug-free vs. medicated), current disease state (relapse vs. remission), or treatment response, were included, as well as studies evaluating the association between symptomatology and neutrophil count or {NLR}.
Results: The available literature was limited with substantial differences in aims, methods, and outcomes. In total, 13 articles were included for the synthesis of this review. Some interesting trends were identified: Neutrophil count and {NLR} seem to be elevated in schizophrenia patients regardless of current or past use of antipsychotic therapy. Neutrophil count and {NLR} correlated significantly with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Still, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to considerable methodological differences and weaknesses in the literature, particularly concerning the blood sampling procedure.
Conclusion: By including longitudinal studies and by comparing patient groups based on medication status, disease state and response, our study provides a basis for dissecting the associations between increased neutrophil count or {NLR} and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Further research should investigate and quantify the apparent strong correlation between neutrophil count or {NLR} and positive symptoms in schizophrenia, to evaluate its clinical potential to guide diagnostics, treatment, or as a predictor of outcome. This review also exposes important methodological weaknesses in the literature on neutrophil count and {NLR} measurements. Standardization of blood sampling and processing is crucial to reduce bias, and factors that are known to influence leukocyte levels need to be accounted for.},

	abstract = {The dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) family is upregulated in many cancers and tied to stemness. Reduced cancer risk has been correlated with disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, in which dopaminergic drugs are used. D2R antagonists are reported to have anticancer efficacy in cell culture and animal models where they have reduced tumor growth, induced autophagy, affected lipid metabolism, and caused apoptosis, among other effects. This has led to several hypotheses, the most prevalent being that D2R ligands may be a novel approach to cancer chemotherapy. This hypothesis is appealing because of the large number of approved and experimental drugs of this class that could be repurposed. We review the current state of the literature and the evidence for and against this hypothesis. When the existing literature is evaluated from a pharmacological context, one of the striking findings is that the concentrations needed for cytotoxic effects of D2R antagonists are orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for this receptor. Although additional definitive studies will provide further clarity, our hypothesis is that targeting D2-like dopamine receptors may only yield useful ligands for cancer chemotherapy in rare cases.},

Results: At concentrations non-toxic to normal cells, aripiprazole inhibited the growth of serum-cultured cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Furthermore, aripiprazole induced differentiation and inhibited sphere formation, as well as stem cell marker expression of cancer stem cells while inhibiting their survivin expression and sensitizing them to chemotherapeutic agents.

A total of 487 incident cases of {PD} without preceding cancer were identified by self-report. Each {PD} case was matched by age to a reference participant who was alive and cancer free at the time of {PD} diagnosis. Both cohorts were followed for incident cancer. We used proportional hazards models to calculate adjusted relative risks ({RR}) for cancer.Results: A total of 121 cancers were confirmed during a median follow-up of 5.2 years ({PD}) and 5.9 years (reference). Those with {PD} developed less cancer (11.0\% versus 14.0\%), with an adjusted {RR} of 0.85 [95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI}), 0.59-1.22]. Reduced risk was present for smoking-related cancers such as lung ({RR}, 0.32), colorectal ({RR}, 0.54), and bladder ({RR}, 0.68), as well as for most non–smoking-related cancers such as prostate cancer ({RR}, 0.74). In contrast, {PD} patients were at significantly increased risk ({RR}, 6.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.77-21.37) for melanoma. {PD} patients who smoked were at reduced risk for smoking-related cancer ({RR}, 0.33; 95\% {CI}, 0.12-0.92), whereas nonsmokers with {PD} were at increased risk ({RR}, 1.80; 95\% {CI}, 0.60-5.39). This interaction was statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.02).Conclusions: Our results suggest a decreased incidence of most cancers in patients with {PD}. {PD} patients had a significantly increased risk of malignant melanoma, a finding consistent with prior studies. We confirmed an interaction between smoking and the relationship of {PD} to smoking-related cancer that may fit the pattern of a gene-environment interaction.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The incidence of cancer in patients with schizophrenia has been conversely reported to be higher, lower, or similar to that in the general population. The effects of lifestyle factors such as excess smoking, exposure to neuroleptic medications, and genetic factors that may influence the incidence of cancer in this group are not clear. The current study was performed to evaluate the frequency of cancer in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia and to determine the standardized incidence ratios ({SIRs}) of any malignancy in this group.
{METHODS}: Data regarding the design, setting, and participants of the current study were analyzed from a cohort of 3226 patients with schizophrenia who were enrolled in the computerized health registry of the Abarbanel Mental Health Center between 1993-2003. The mean age of the patients at the time of the diagnosis of cancer was 49 +/- 14.7 years, with the majority of patients (61\%) being male. All patients with schizophrenia records in the database were combined with the records of the Israeli National Cancer Registry to identify pathologically confirmed cancer comorbidity. The cancer incidence rates among patients with schizophrenia were compared with the expected incidence in an age-matched and gender-matched general population sample for the same time interval.
{RESULTS}: Among 1247 female patients with schizophrenia, 22 (1.8\%) developed breast cancer and 68 (5.5\%) developed cancers of any type. Fifty-two of the 1979 male schizophrenic patients (2.6\%) developed cancer. The {SIRs} were 0.58 (95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}], 0.48-0.69) with a P value of {\textless} 0.05 for all cancers in the cohort, and 0.60 (95\% {CI}, 0.37-0.90) for female breast cancer.

Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify {FDA}-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-{ALL}. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward {MYC}-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-{ALL} cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-{ALL} cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) as a perphenazine target. T-{ALL} cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple {PP}2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, {shRNA} knockdown of specific {PP}2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that {PP}2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-{ALLs} treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of {PP}2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic {PP}2A activation in T-{ALL} and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated {PP}2A substrates has therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Dopamine receptor D2 ({DRD}2) is a G protein-coupled receptor antagonized by {ONC}201, an anticancer small molecule in clinical trials for high-grade gliomas and other malignancies. {DRD}5 is a dopamine receptor family member that opposes {DRD}2 signaling. We investigated the expression of these dopamine receptors in cancer and their influence on tumor cell sensitivity to {ONC}201.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to determine {DRD}2/{DRD}5 expression broadly across human cancers. Cell viability assays were performed with {ONC}201 in {\textgreater}1,000 Genomic of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and {NCI}60 cell lines. {IHC} staining of {DRD}2/{DRD}5 was performed on tissue microarrays and archival tumor tissues of glioblastoma patients treated with {ONC}201. Whole exome sequencing was performed in {RKO} cells with and without acquired {ONC}201 resistance. Wild-type and mutant {DRD}5 constructs were generated for overexpression studies.
{RESULTS}: {DRD}2 overexpression broadly occurs across tumor types and is associated with a poor prognosis. Whole exome sequencing of cancer cells with acquired resistance to {ONC}201 revealed a de novo Q366R mutation in the {DRD}5 gene. Expression of Q366R {DRD}5 was sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis, consistent with a gain-of-function. {DRD}5 overexpression in glioblastoma cells enhanced {DRD}2/{DRD}5 heterodimers and {DRD}5 expression was inversely correlated with innate tumor cell sensitivity to {ONC}201. Investigation of archival tumor samples from patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with {ONC}201 revealed that low {DRD}5 expression was associated with relatively superior clinical outcomes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results implicate {DRD}5 as a negative regulator of {DRD}2 signaling and tumor sensitivity to {ONC}201 {DRD}2 antagonism.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of phenothiazines (at clinically relevant doses) on the viability and proliferation of leukemic cell lines and normal lymphocytes, and to investigate the possibility of specific induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells.
{METHODS}: Phenothiazines with different chemical structure and hydrophobicity were used: chlorpromazine ({CPZ}); levomepromazine ({LVPZ}); prometazine ({PMZ}); trifluoperazine ({TFPZ}); thioridazine ({TRDZ}). The leukemic cell lines used were: Daudi and Raji (derived from Burkitt's lymphoma), K-562 (derived from myelogenous leukemia), and {BALL}-1, {MOLT}-4, {HPB}-{ALL} and {CCRF}-{HSB}-2 (derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The cytotoxicity of the phenothiazines was determined by a {CellTiter}-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, using {ATP} bioluminescence as a marker of cell viability as well as a marker of mitochondrial activity. The proliferation of leukemic cells was determined using a {CellTiter}-{AQ} cell proliferation assay which is based on the reduction of a methyl-tetrazolium compound to the formazan product. Apoptosis induction was estimated using phosphatidylserine ({PSer}) translocation to the cell surface and {DNA} fragmentation as characteristics of the process.
{RESULTS}: Phenothiazines (at concentrations in the range 0.1-10 micro M) did not affect the viability of normal lymphocytes during a 24-h incubation. Moreover, about 15-20\% increase in {ATP} bioluminescence was observed in normal cells during treatment with 40 micro M phenothiazines. In contrast, the phenothiazines manifested strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against leukemic cells. The most powerful drugs were {TFPZ} and {TRDZ}, followed by {CPZ}. They showed a significant cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells even at 5-10 micro M. The most sensitive cell lines were {MOLT}-4 and Raji, and the most resistant were {HPB}-{ALL} and {CCRF}-{HSB}-2. All phenothiazines induced {PSer} exposure on the surface of leukemic cells, but not of normal lymphocytes. {TFPZ}, {TRDZ} and {CPZ} also induced {DNA} fragmentation in almost all leukemic cell lines during a 48-h incubation. The strongest apoptotic agent was {TRDZ}. The apoptosis induction was not accompanied by a significant release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of native cells. Moreover, the drugs markedly suppressed Ca(2+)-induced cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria of leukemic cells.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that in clinically relevant doses (up to 20 micro M) some phenothiazines ({TFPZ}, {TRDZ}, {CPZ}) expressed a selective cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity, and induced apoptosis in leukemic cells without any influence on the viability of normal lymphocytes. It is considered that the mechanism of apoptosis induction in phenothiazine-treated leukemic cells is associated with inhibition of mitochondrial {DNA} polymerase and decreased {ATP} production, which are crucial events for the viability of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the relationships between dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia using meta-analysis.

Method
The {PubMed}, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched to identify relevant literature published up to February 2016. The allele contrast model was used. Stata software was used for statistical analysis, with odds ratios ({ORs}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) calculated to evaluate the associations between dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia. Meta-regression and publication bias, trim-and-fill, subgroup, sensitivity, cumulative, and fail-safe number analyses were also performed.

Results
This meta-analysis included 81 studies. The rs1801028 and rs1799732 were associated with schizophrenia risk among Asians (P=0.04, {OR} =1.25, 95\% {CI} =1.01–1.55; P{\textless}0.01, {OR} =0.76, 95\% {CI} =0.63–0.92, respectively), while the rs6277 was associated with schizophrenia risk in Caucasians (P{\textless}0.01, {OR}=0.72, 95\% {CI} =0.66–0.79). The rs1800497 was also associated with schizophrenia risk in population-based controls (P{\textless}0.01, {OR} =0.84, 95\% {CI} =0.72–0.97). The rs6275, rs1079597, and rs1800498 were not associated with schizophrenia risk. In addition, meta-regression indicated that the controls may be sources of heterogeneity for the rs1801028 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}), while ethnicity may be sources of heterogeneity for the rs6277 {SNP}. Publication bias was significant for the rs1801028 {SNP}, and this result changed after the publication bias was adjusted using the trim-and-fill method.

Conclusion
This meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs1801028 may be a risk factor for susceptibility to schizophrenia among Asians, while the rs1799732 may be a protective factor for that population. Large-sample studies are necessary to verify the results of this meta-analysis.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neo.2017.10.002},
	abstract = {{ONC}201/{TIC}10 is a first-in-class small molecule inducer of {TRAIL} that causes early activation of the integrated stress response. Its promising safety profile and broad-spectrum efficacy in vitro have been confirmed in Phase I/{II} trials in several advanced malignancies. Binding and reporter assays have shown that {ONC}201 is a selective antagonist of the dopamine D2-like receptors, specifically, {DRD}2 and {DRD}3. We hypothesized that {ONC}201's interaction with {DRD}2 plays a role in {ONC}201's anticancer effects. Using {cBioportal} and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses, we confirmed that {DRD}2 is expressed in different cancer cell types in a cell type-specific manner. On the other hand, {DRD}3 was generally not detectable. Overexpressing {DRD}2 in cells with low {DRD}2 levels increased {ONC}201-induced {PARP} cleavage, which was preceded and correlated with an increase in {ONC}201-induced {CHOP} {mRNA} expression. On the other hand, knocking out {DRD}2 using {CRISPR}/Cas9 in three cancer cell lines was not sufficient to abrogate {ONC}201's anticancer effects. Although {ONC}201's anticancer activity was not dependent on {DRD}2 expression in the cancer cell types tested, we assessed the cytotoxic potential of {DRD}2 blockade. Transient {DRD}2 knockdown in {HCT}116 cells activated the integrated stress response and reduced cell number. Pharmacological antagonism of {DRD}2 significantly reduced cell viability. Thus, we demonstrate in this study that disrupting dopamine receptor expression and activity can have cytotoxic effects that may at least be in part due to the activation of the integrated stress response. On the other hand, {ONC}201's anticancer activity goes beyond its ability to antagonize {DRD}2, potentially due to {ONC}201's ability to activate other pathways that are independent of {DRD}2. Nevertheless, blocking the dopamine D1-like receptor {DRD}5 via {siRNA} or the use of a pharmacological antagonist promoted {ONC}201-induced anticancer activity.},

	abstract = {Dopamine is a biologically active compound belonging to catecholamines. It plays its roles in the human body, acting both as a circulating hormone and neurotransmitter. It acts through G-protein-coupled receptors divided into two subgroups: D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R) and D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, D4R). Physiologically, dopamine receptors are involved in central nervous system functions: motivation or cognition, and peripheral actions such as blood pressure and immune response modulation. Increasing evidence indicates that the dopamine D1 receptor may play a significant role in developing different human neoplasms. This receptor’s value was presented in the context of regulating various signaling pathways important in tumor development, including neoplastic cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, migration, invasiveness, or the enrichment of cancer stem cells population. Recent studies proved that its activation by selective or non-selective agonists is associated with significant tumor growth suppression, metastases prevention, and tumor microvasculature maturation. It may also exert a synergistic anti-cancer effect when combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or temozolomide. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the heterogeneity of dopamine D1 receptor molecular roles and signaling pathways in human neoplasm development and discusses possible perspectives of its therapeutic targeting as an adjunct anti-cancer strategy of treatment. We highlight the priorities for further directions in this research area.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by rather selective degeneration of the dopaminergic ({DA}) neurons in the substantia nigra. Though subject to intensive research, the etiology of this nigral neuronal loss is still enigmatic and treatment is basically symptomatic. The current major hypothesis suggests that nigral neuronal death in {PD} is due to excessive oxidative stress generated by auto- and enzymatic oxidation of the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine ({DA}), the formation of neuromelanin and presence of high concentrations of iron. We have found that {DA} toxicity is mediated through its oxidative metabolites. Whereas thiol-containing antioxidants provided marked protection against {DA} toxicity, ascorbic acid accelerated {DA}-induced death. Using the differential display approach, we sought to isolate and characterize genes whose expression is altered in response to {DA} toxicity. We found an upregulation of the collapsin response mediator protein ({CRM}) and {TCP}-1delta in sympathetic neurons, which undergo dopamine-induced apoptosis. The isolation of these genes led us to examine the expression and activity of {CRM} and {TCP}-1delta related genes. Indeed, we found a significant induction of {mRNAs} of the secreted collapsin-1 and the mitochondrial stress protein {HSP}60. Antibodies directed against collapsin-1 provided marked and prolonged protection of several neuronal cell types from dopamine-induced apoptosis. In a parallel study, using antisense technology, we found that inhibition of {TCP}-1delta expression significantly reduced {DA}-induced neuronal death. These findings suggest a functional role for collapsin-1 and {TCP}-1delta as positive mediators of {DA}-induced neuronal apoptosis.},

During {NETosis}, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps ({NETs}), which can capture and kill bacteria and other pathogens to prevent them from spreading. Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of {NETosis}, the precise mechanism underlying {NETosis} is still a matter of debate. Research continues to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in {NETosis}. In recent years, interactions with the complement and coagulation systems have become increasingly apparent. Activated complement proteins can stimulate {NET} formation, and {NETs}, in turn, can serve as a platform for complement activation. In addition, {NETs} can act as a scaffold for thrombus formation during coagulation. While crosstalk between the coagulation and complement systems has been previously described, {NETosis} appears to be a third important player in this consortium to protect the host against pathogens. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the mutual interactions between {NETosis}, the complement system and the coagulation system, with an emerging description of their complex triangular relationship.},

	abstract = {Background
The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic is currently leading to increasing numbers of {COVID}-19 patients all over the world. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system.

Methods
In order to dissect {COVID}-19-driven immune host responses, we performed {RNA}-seq of whole blood cell transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe {COVID}-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis. Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the distinction from {COVID}-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates based on finding from data-driven findings.

Results
Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 {COVID}-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 16 {COVID}-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of {COVID}-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for {COVID}-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host.

Conclusions
Our study provides novel insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for {COVID}-19 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of disease severity.

Functional analyses demonstrated spontaneous inflammasome formation and production of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines {IL}-1β and {IL}-18, with the latter exceeding the levels seen in {CAPS}. The {NLRC}4 mutation caused constitutive caspase-1 cleavage in cells transduced with mutant {NLRC}4 and increased production of {IL}-18 in both patient-derived and mutant {NLRC}4-transduced macrophages. Thus, we describe a new monoallelic inflammasome defect that expands the monogenic autoinflammatory disease spectrum to include {MAS} and suggests new targets for therapy.},

Many patients had chronic neutropenia associated with oral and rectal ulcers. The marked prevalence of infections caused by intracellular pathogens suggests some degree of impairment of cell-mediated immunity. Although lymphocyte counts and in vitro proliferation to mitogens were normal, a defective in vitro proliferative response to antigens was observed in some patients, and additional defects of cell-mediated immunity may be presumed on the basis of current knowledge of {CD}40-ligand function. All patients received regular infusions of immunoglobulins. Four patients underwent liver transplantation because of sclerosing cholangitis, which relapsed in there. Three patients underwent bone marrow transplantation. Thirteen patients (23\%) died of infection and/or liver disease.

Genetic variation in Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}), key innate immune receptors or their signalling molecules, have been described. Variation in certain {TLRs} has been linked to disease susceptibility. This genetic variation can result in an altered immune response to pathogenic challenge as well as exorbitant immune activation and inflammation, and thus may influence the pathogenesis or outcome of disease. Examples include variants of {TLR}4 in sepsis, malaria, inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis; variants in {TLR}2 in tuberculosis and asthma; a variant in Mal (a key signal for {TLR}2 and {TLR}4) in malaria, tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus; and variants in the kinase {IRAK}4 in pyogenic infections. These associations provide us with a validation for the role of {TLRs} in human disease, and also suggest possible strategies to limit or boost {TLR} function in the effort to develop new therapies.},

In this role, {TLR}1 enables host responses to a variety of bacteria, including pathogenic species of mycobacteria. In this study, we report that I602S, a common single nucleotide polymorphism within {TLR}1, is associated with aberrant trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface and diminished responses of blood monocytes to bacterial agonists. When expressed in heterologous systems, the {TLR}1 602S variant, but not the {TLR}1 602I variant, exhibits the expected deficiencies in trafficking and responsiveness. Among white Europeans, the 602S allele represents the most common single nucleotide polymorphism affecting {TLR} function identified to date. Surprisingly, the 602S allele is associated with a decreased incidence of leprosy, suggesting that Mycobacterium leprae subverts the {TLR} system as a mechanism of immune evasion.},

	abstract = {X-linked hyper {IgM} syndrome ({HIGM}1), a disorder of abnormal T- and B-cell function, is characterized by low serum concentrations of {IgG}, {IgA}, and {IgE} with normal or elevated serum concentrations of {IgM}. Mitogen proliferation may be normal, but {NK}- and T-cell cytotoxicity can be impaired. Antigen-specific responses are usually decreased or absent. Total numbers of B cells are normal but there is a marked reduction of class-switched memory B cells. Defective oxidative burst of both neutrophils and macrophages has been reported. The range of clinical findings varies, even within the same family. More than 50\% of males with {HIGM}1 develop symptoms by age one year, and more than 90\% are symptomatic by age four years. {HIGM}1 usually presents in infancy with recurrent upper- and lower-respiratory tract bacterial infections, opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and recurrent or protracted diarrhea that can be infectious or noninfectious and is associated with failure to thrive. Neutropenia is common; thrombocytopenia and anemia are less commonly seen. Autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (such as sclerosing cholangitis) as well as increased risk for neoplasms have been reported as medical complications of this disorder. Significant neurologic complications, often the result of a {CNS} infection, are seen in 5\%-15\% of affected males. Liver disease, a serious complication of {HIGM}1 once observed in more than 80\% of affected males by age 20 years, may be decreasing with adequate screening and treatment of Cryptosporidium infection., The diagnosis of X-linked hyper {IgM} syndrome is established in a male proband with typical clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in {CD}40LG identified by molecular genetic testing., Treatment of manifestations: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ({HSCT}) (the only curative treatment currently available), ideally performed before age ten years, prior to evidence of organ damage; immunoglobulin replacement therapy (either intravenous or subcutaneous); appropriate antimicrobial therapy for acute infections; antimicrobial prophylaxis for opportunistic infection against Pneumocysitis jirovecii pneumonia; recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for chronic neutropenia; immunosuppressants for autoimmune disorders. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Areas that place individual at risk of contracting Cryptosporidium including pools, lakes, ponds, or certain water sources; drinking unpurified or unfiltered water; live vaccines such as rotavirus, {MMR}, varicella, live attenuated polio, and {BCG}. Surveillance: At least annually: {CBC} with differential to monitor for cytopenias, testing of {IgG} levels and lymphocyte subpopulations, pulmonary function tests after age seven years. Regular assessment of liver function, consider abdominal imaging; as well as polymerase chain reaction-based testing for the presence of enteric pathogens including Cryptosporidium. Monitor growth and general health with a low threshold for lymph node biopsy, given elevated oncologic risk. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of newborn at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment and prevention of infections., By definition, X-linked hyper {IgM} syndrome ({HIGM}1) is inherited in an X-linked manner. Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all their daughters and none of their sons. Women with a {CD}40LG pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Female who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically be asymptomatic but may have a range of clinical manifestation depending on X-chromosome inactivation. Once the {CD}40LG pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for {HIGM}1 are possible.},

	abstract = {Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy candidiasis ectodermal dystrophy ({APECED}) is a rare life-threatening autoimmune disease that attacks multiple organs and has its onset in childhood. It is an inherited condition caused by a variety of mutations in the autoimmune regulator ({AIRE}) gene that encodes a protein whose function has been uncovered by the generation and study of Aire-{KO} mice. These provided invaluable insights into the link between {AIRE} expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells ({mTECs}), and the broad spectrum of self-antigens that these cells express and present to the developing thymocytes. However, these murine models poorly recapitulate all phenotypic aspects of human {APECED}. Unlike Aire-{KO} mice, the recently generated Aire-{KO} rat model presents visual features, organ lymphocytic infiltrations and production of autoantibodies that resemble those observed in {APECED} patients, making the rat model a main research asset. In addition, ex vivo models of {AIRE}-dependent self-antigen expression in primary {mTECs} have been successfully set up. Thymus organoids based on pluripotent stem cell-derived {TECs} from {APECED} patients are also emerging, and constitute a promising tool to engineer {AIRE}-corrected {mTECs} and restore the generation of regulatory T cells. Eventually, these new models will undoubtedly lead to main advances in the identification and assessment of specific and efficient new therapeutic strategies aiming to restore immunological tolerance in {APECED} patients., Summary: In this Review, we discuss the in vivo and in vitro models available to study {AIRE} deficiency, and how they may contribute to restoring immunological tolerance in {APECED} patients.},

	abstract = {The existence of enteric dopaminergic neurons has been suspected; however, the innervation of the gut by sympathetic nerves, in which dopamine ({DA}) is the norepinephrine precursor, complicates analyses of enteric {DA}. We now report that transcripts encoding tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}) and the {DA} transporter ({DAT}) are present in the murine bowel (small intestine {\textgreater} stomach or colon; proximal colon {\textgreater} distal colon). Because sympathetic neurons are extrinsic, transcripts encoding {TH} and {DAT} in the bowel are probably derived from intrinsic neurons. {TH} protein was demonstrated immunocytochemically in neuronal perikarya (submucosal {\textgreater}{\textgreater} myenteric plexus; small intestine {\textgreater} stomach or colon). {TH}, {DA}, and {DAT} immunoreactivities were coincident in subsets of neurons (submucosal {\textgreater} myenteric) in guinea pig and mouse intestines in situ and in cultured guinea pig enteric ganglia. Surgical ablation of sympathetic nerves by extrinsic denervation of loops of the bowel did not affect {DAT} immunoreactivity but actually increased numbers of {TH}-immunoreactive neurons, expression of {mRNA} encoding {TH} and {DAT}, and enteric {DOPAC} (the specific dopamine metabolite). The fetal gut contains transiently catecholaminergic ({TC}) cells. {TC} cells are the proliferating crest-derived precursors of mature neurons that are not catecholaminergic and, thus, disappear after embryonic day (E) 14 (mouse) or E15 (rat). {TC} cells appear early in ontogeny, and their development/survival is dependent on mash-1 gene expression. In contrast, the intrinsic {TH}-expressing neurons of the murine bowel appear late (perinatally) and are mash-1 independent. We conclude that the enteric nervous system contains intrinsic dopaminergic neurons that arise from a mash-1-independent lineage of noncatecholaminergic precursors.},

	abstract = {The dopaminergic system controls several vital central nervous system functions, including the control of movement, reward behaviors and cognition. Alterations of dopaminergic signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, in particular Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with a subtle and chronic inflammatory response. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated the non-neuronal expression of dopamine, its receptors and of the machinery that governs synthesis, secretion and storage of dopamine across several immune cell types. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role and expression of dopamine in immune cells. One of the goals is to decipher the complex mechanisms through which these cell types respond to dopamine, in order to address the impact this has on neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. A further aim is to illustrate the gaps in our understanding of the physiological roles of dopamine to encourage more targeted research focused on understanding the consequences of aberrant dopamine production on immune regulation. These highlights may prompt scientists in the field to consider alternative functions of this important neurotransmitter when targeting neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative pathologies.},

The association with chronic lower respiratory disease mortality was stronger in individuals with prevalent lung diseases ({HR} 1.46, 95\% {CI} 1.14–1.88, Pinteraction = 0.01), while {NLR} showed positive associations with mortality from heart disease (1.21, 1.07–1.38) and cerebrovascular disease (1.30, 1.04–1.63) only among individuals without these conditions at baseline. {NLR} is associated with mortality overall and due to certain causes in the general population. Associations over short follow-up intervals and among individuals with conditions at baseline suggest effects of disordered inflammation and immunity on progression of those conditions, while other associations may reflect contributions to disease etiology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is more effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. Unlike classic neuroleptic agents, clozapine is not associated with the development of acute extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia. The main factor limiting its use is the risk of potentially fatal agranulocytosis, estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of treated patients. After clozapine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it became available for marketing in the United States in February 1990 only as part of a special surveillance system (the Clozaril Patient Management System, or {CPMS}), in which a weekly white-cell count was required for the patient to receive a supply of the drug.
{METHODS}: We evaluated the {CPMS} data for February 1990 through April 1991 by survival analysis to determine the incidence of agranulocytosis and the effects of potential risk factors such as age and sex. Data were available for 11,555 patients who received clozapine during the period after marketing began.
{RESULTS}: Agranulocytosis developed in 73 patients, resulting in death from infectious complications in 2 patients. Episodes of agranulocytosis occurred in 61 patients within three months after they began treatment. The cumulative incidence of this side effect was 0.80 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99) at 1 year and 0.91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.20) at 1 1/2 years. The risk of agranulocytosis increased with age and was higher among women.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The occurrence of agranulocytosis is a substantial hazard of the administration of clozapine, but this hazard can be reduced by monitoring the white-cell count. The increasing risk of agranulocytosis with age and the reduced incidence after the first six months of treatment provide additional guidelines for the prescription and monitoring of clozapine treatment in the future.},

	abstract = {Background: For the normal resolution of an acute inflammatory response, neutrophil ({PMN}) apoptosis is essential to maintain immune homeostasis and to limit inappropriate host tissue damage. A delay in {PMN} apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({SIRS}). Dopamine, a biogenic amine with known cardiovascular and neurotransmitter properties, is used in patients with {SIRS} to maintain hemodynamic stability. We sought to determine whether dopamine may also have immunoregulatory properties capable of influencing {PMN} apoptosis, function, and activation state in patients with {SIRS}. Methods: {PMNs} were isolated from healthy volunteers and patients with {SIRS} and treated with varying doses of dopamine and a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam. {PMN} apoptosis was assessed every 6 hours with use of propidium iodide {DNA} staining and {PMN} function was assessed with use of respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis ability, and {CD}11a, {CD}11b, and {CD}18 receptor expression as functional markers. Results: There was a significant delay in {PMN} apotosis in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment of isolated {PMNs} from both healthy controls and patients with {SIRS} with 10 and 100 μmol/L dopamine induced apoptosis. {PMN} ingestive and cytocidal capacity were both decreased in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment with dopamine significantly increased phagocytic function. Fenoldopam did not induce {PMN} apoptosis. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate for the first time that dopamine induces {PMN} apoptosis and modulates {PMN} function both in healthy controls and in patients with {SIRS}. These results indicate that dopamine may be beneficial during {SIRS} through a nonhemodynamic {PMN}-dependent proapoptotic mechanism. (Surgery 1999;126:314-22.)},

	abstract = {X-linked agammaglobulinemia or {XLA} is one of the most common pediatric primary immunodeficiencies that prevent affected individuals from making antibodies and requires lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy for survival. The molecular basis for {XLA} is a disruption in B cell development due to mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Affected individuals inherit a defect that prevents precursor B cells in the bone marrow from forming mature, circulating B-lymphocytes that would otherwise be capable of proliferating and differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells in secondary lymphoid organs like the tonsils and lymph nodes. This dysfunction results in dangerously low, clinically undetectable levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes in the serum. Without immunoglobulins (or antibodies), {XLA} patients are rendered vulnerable to invasive infections from encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae), have an increased incidence of enterovirus infections (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus), and chronic diarrhea (from Giardia lamblia). {XLA} patients commonly present with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis and otitis media, beginning after 6 to 9 months when most of the maternal antibodies have been exhausted.  However, hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia, requiring intravenous antibiotics for resolution, is usually what prompts the diagnostic work-up for immune deficiency disease. The average age of diagnosis is 2.5 years, and almost all cases of {XLA} get diagnosed before 5 years of age. Notably, late-onset forms of {XLA} also exist. There is currently no cure for {XLA}; however, early management with immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antibiotics to prevent and treat infections. Although this lifelong avenue is costly, it has been the mainstay of treatment for the past fifty years. Any significant delay in diagnosis poses the danger of developing chronic, treatment-resistant infections, and end-organ damage that cannot be corrected.},

	abstract = {Background The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) in peripheral blood is a well-established inflammatory marker, but its role in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) remains unclear. Objectives To determine whether a different peripheral immune profile and {NLR} were present in {PD} patients. Methods We conducted a case–control study that included 377 {PD} patients and 355 healthy controls ({HCs}). Leukocytes, subpopulations, and the {NLR} were measured. Multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to determine the differences between groups and the association between {NLR} and clinical characteristics in {PD}. A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the association between {NLR} and {PD}. Results In our case–control study, the {NLR} was significantly higher in {PD} patients compared with {HCs} (2.47 ± 1.1 vs. 1.98 ± 0.91, P {\textless} 0.001). No association between {NLR} and age at onset, disease severity, or disease duration was found. The meta-analysis showed that the {NLR} was likely to be higher in {PD} patients. Conclusions {PD} patients had an altered peripheral immune profile and a higher {NLR} compared with {HCs}. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society},

	abstract = {The neuropathological hallmarks of Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) are the degeneration and death of dopamine-producing neurons in the ventral midbrain, the widespread intraneuronal aggregation of alpha-synuclein (a-syn) in Lewy bodies and neurites, neuroinflammation, and gliosis. Signs of microglia activation in the {PD} brain postmortem as well as during disease development revealed by neuroimaging, implicate immune responses in the pathophysiology of the disease. Intensive research during the last two decades has advanced our understanding of the role of these responses in the disease process, yet many questions remain unanswered. A transformative finding in the field has been the confirmation that in vivo microglia are able to respond directly to pathological a-syn aggregates but also to neuronal dysfunction due to intraneuronal a-syn toxicity well in advance of neuronal death. In addition, clinical research and disease models have revealed the involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Indeed, the data suggest that {PD} leads not only to a microglia response, but also to a cellular and humoral peripheral immune response. Together, these findings compel us to consider a more holistic view of the immunological processes associated with the disease. Central and peripheral immune responses aimed at maintaining neuronal health will ultimately have consequences on neuronal survival. We will review here the most significant findings that have contributed to the current understanding of the immune response in {PD}, which is proposed to occur early, involve peripheral and brain immune cells, evolve as neuronal dysfunction progresses, and is likely to influence disease progression.,

We summarise studies conducted in our laboratory over the last 2 decades, outlining the incremental development of our hypotheses, the starting point for which is our early work on executive deficits mirroring fronto-striatal dysfunction. We present subsequent findings linking these deficits to a model of dopaminergic function that conforms to an inverted curvilinear function. We review studies that investigated the range of dopamine-independent attentional and visuospatial memory deficits seen in {PD}, demonstrating that abnormalities in these domains more accurately predict {PDD}. We conclude with an exposition of the dual syndrome hypothesis, which distinguishes between dopaminergically mediated fronto-striatal executive impairments and a dementia syndrome with distinctive prodromal visuospatial deficits in which cholinergic treatments offer some clinical benefits.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the death of neurons, ie, cells critical to the production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Here, we present a brief review of the dopamine synthetic pathway, binding to the dopamine receptors, and subsequent action. The production of dopamine (a monoamine neurotransmitter) occurs in the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) of the substantia nigra, specifically in the hypothalamic nucleus and midbrain. Compared to other monoamines, dopamine is widely distributed in the olfactory bulb, midbrain substantia nigra, hypothalamus, {VTA}, retina, and the periaqueductal gray area. Dopamine receptors are large G-protein coupled receptor family members, of which there are five subtypes including D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. These subtypes are further divided into two subclasses: D1-like family receptors (types 1 and 5) and D2-like family receptors (types 2, 3, and 4). Four different pathways and functions of the dopaminergic system are presented in this review. In the oxidation of dopamine, 5,6-indolequinone, dopamine-o-quinone, and aminochrome are formed. It is difficult to separate the roles of 5,6-indolequinone and dopamine-o-quinone in the degenerative process of Parkinson’s diseases due to their instability. The role of aminochrome in Parkinson’s disease is to form and stabilize the neurotoxic protofibrils of alpha-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the degradation of protein by lysosomal systems and proteasomes. The neurotoxic effects of aminochrome can be inhibited by preventing the polymerization of 5,6-indolequinone, dopamine-o-quinone, and aminochrome into neuromelanin, by reducing aminochrome catalysis by {DT}-diaphorase, and by preventing dopamine oxidative deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase. In addition to these, the conversion of dopamine in the neuromelanin ({NM}) shows both protective and toxic roles. Therefore, the aims of this review were to discuss and explain the role of dopamine and explore its physiology and specificity in Parkinson's disease, as well as its role in other physiological functions.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused mainly by lack of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory, and other functions; its level is decreased in {PD} brain as a result of dopaminergic cell death. Dopamine loss in {PD} brain is a cause of motor deficiency and, possibly, a reason of the cognitive deficit observed in some {PD} patients. {PD} is mostly not recognized in its early stage because of a long latency between the first damage to dopaminergic cells and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is very important to find reliable molecular biomarkers that can distinguish {PD} from other conditions, monitor its progression, or give an indication of a positive response to a therapeutic intervention. {PD} biomarkers can be subdivided into four main types: clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic. For a long time protein biomarkers, dopamine metabolites, amino acids, etc. in blood, serum, cerebrospinal liquid ({CSF}) were considered the most promising. Among the candidate biomarkers that have been tested, various forms of α-synuclein (α-syn), i.e., soluble, aggregated, post-translationally modified, etc. were considered potentially the most efficient. However, the encouraging recent results suggest that {microRNA}-based analysis may bring considerable progress, especially if it is combined with α-syn data. Another promising analysis is the advanced metabolite profiling of body fluids, called “metabolomics” which may uncover metabolic fingerprints specific for various stages of {PD}. Conventional pharmacological treatment of {PD} is based on the replacement of dopamine using dopamine precursors (levodopa, L-{DOPA}, L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine), dopamine agonists (amantadine, apomorphine) and {MAO}-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), which can be used alone or in combination with each other. Potential risk factors include environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular damage, and genomic defects. This review covers molecules that might act as the biomarkers of {PD}. Then, {PD} risk factors (including genetics and non-genetic factors) and {PD} treatment options are discussed.},

D1-like receptor signaling is mediated chiefly by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαs and Gαolf, which cause sequential activation of adenylate cyclase, cylic {AMP}-dependent protein kinase, and the protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor {DARPP}-32. The increased phosphorylation that results from the combined effects of activating cyclic {AMP}-dependent protein kinase and inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 regulates the activity of many receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and transcription factors. D1 or a novel D1-like receptor also signals via phospholipase C-dependent and cyclic {AMP}-independent mobilization of intracellular calcium. D2-like receptor signaling is mediated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαi and Gαo. These pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins regulate some effectors, such as adenylate cyclase, via their Gα subunits, but regulate many more effectors such as ion channels, phospholipases, protein kinases, and receptor tyrosine kinases as a result of the receptor-induced liberation of Gβγ subunits. In addition to interactions between dopamine receptors and G proteins, other protein:protein interactions such as receptor oligomerization or receptor interactions with scaffolding and signal-switching proteins are critical for regulation of dopamine receptor signaling.},

Circulating neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection by host- and/or pathogen-derived components, which also prime these host cells for enhanced microbicidal activity. {PMNs} bind and ingest microorganisms by a process known as phagocytosis, which typically triggers production of reactive oxygen species and the fusion of cytoplasmic granules with pathogen-containing vacuoles. The combination of neutrophil reactive oxygen species and granule components is highly effective in killing most bacteria and fungi. Inasmuch as {PMNs} are the most abundant type of leukocyte in humans and contain an arsenal of cytotoxic compounds that are non-specific, neutrophil homeostasis must be highly regulated. To that end, constitutive {PMN} turnover is regulated by apoptosis, a process whereby these cells shut down and are removed safely by macrophages. Notably, apoptosis is accelerated following phagocytosis of bacteria, a process that appears important for the resolution of infection and inflammation.

We obtained terminally mature neutrophils after differentiation of immature transfectable {PLB}-985 myeloid cells by treatment with dimethylformamide (0.5\%), Nutridoma {SP} (1\%) and fetal calf serum (0.5\%). Maturation was shown by functional degranulation, in response to bacterial N-formyl peptide ({fMLP}), of specific granules and secretory vesicle contents; the latter emerge during the last step of normal neutrophil differentiation into bone marrow. These differentiated cells also produced quantities of superoxide anion similar to those produced by blood neutrophils, in response to physiological stimuli ({fMLP}); in addition, the {fMLP}-induced respiratory burst was primed by the proinflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Thus, in our experimental conditions, {PLB}-985 cells transformed into fully differentiated neutrophils capable of fine regulation by inflammatory agents. This cell model will help in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophil functions.},

	abstract = {Studies of cellular apoptosis have been significantly impacted since the introduction of flow cytometry-based methods. Propidium iodide ({PI}) is widely used in conjunction with Annexin V to determine if cells are viable, apoptotic, or necrotic through differences in plasma membrane integrity and permeability1,2. The Annexin V/ {PI} protocol is a commonly used approach for studying apoptotic cells3. {PI} is used more often than other nuclear stains because it is economical, stable and a good indicator of cell viability, based on its capacity to exclude dye in living cells 4,5. The ability of {PI} to enter a cell is dependent upon the permeability of the membrane; {PI} does not stain live or early apoptotic cells due to the presence of an intact plasma membrane 1,2,6. In late apoptotic and necrotic cells, the integrity of the plasma and nuclear membranes decreases7,8, allowing {PI} to pass through the membranes, intercalate into nucleic acids, and display red fluorescence 1,2,9. Unfortunately, we find that conventional Annexin V/ {PI} protocols lead to a significant number of false positive events (up to 40\%), which are associated with {PI} staining of {RNA} within the cytoplasmic compartment10. Primary cells and cell lines in a broad range of animal models are affected, with large cells (nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios {\textless}0.5) showing the highest occurrence10. Herein, we demonstrate a modified Annexin V/ {PI} method that provides a significant improvement for assessment of cell death compared to conventional methods. This protocol takes advantage of changes in cellular permeability during cell fixing to promote entry of {RNase} A into cells following staining. Both the timing and concentration of {RNase} A have been optimized for removal of cytoplasmic {RNA}. The result is a significant improvement over conventional Annexin V/ {PI} protocols ({\textless} 5\% events with cytoplasmic {PI} staining).},

	abstract = {Background: On the current psychopharmacological panorama, the variety of substances able to provoke an episode of acute psychosis is rapidly increasing. Such psychotic episodes are classified according to the major category of symptoms: positive, negative, or cognitive psychotic episodes. On one hand, the abuse of methamphetamines, cannabis, and cocaine plays a big role in increasing the incidence of episodes resembling a psychotic disorder. On the other hand, the progress in terms of pharmacodynamics knowledge has led to the synthesis of new drugs, such as cannabinoids and cathinone's, which have rapidly entered into the common pool of abusers' habits. Regarding these newly synthesized substances of abuse, further clinical studies are needed to understand their psychogenic properties. The topic of this review is complicated due to the frequent abuse of psychotomimetic drugs by patients affected by psychotic disorders, a fact that makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between an induced psychosis and a re-exacerbation of a previously diagnosed disorder., Methods: The present narrative review summarizes results from clinical studies, thus investigating the psychotogenic properties of abused substances and the psychotic symptoms they can give rise to. It also discusses the association between substance abuse and psychosis, especially with regards to the differential diagnosis between a primary vs. a substance-induced psychotic disorder., Findings: Our findings support the theory that psychosis due to substance abuse is commonly observed in clinical practice. The propensity to develop psychosis seems to be a function of the severity of use and addiction. Of note, from a phenomenological point of view, it is possible to identify some elements that may help clinicians involved in differential diagnoses between primary and substance-induced psychoses. There remains a striking paucity of information on the outcomes, treatments, and best practices of substance-induced psychotic episodes.},

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, has been reported to be higher in patients with {PD} than in healthy controls ({HCs}). The present study was aimed at determining if the peripheral inflammatory immune response could be influenced by the genetic background of patients with {PD}. We included a discovery cohort with 222 patients with {PD} (132 sporadic {PD}, 44 {LRRK}2-associated {PD} (with p.G2019S and p.R1441G variants), and 46 {GBA}-associated {PD}), as well as 299 {HCs}. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Leukocytes and their subpopulations, and the {NLR} were measured in peripheral blood. Multivariate lineal regression and post-hoc tests were applied to determine the differences among the groups. Subsequently, a replication study using the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort was performed which included 401 patients with {PD} (281 {sPD} patients, 66 {LRRK}2-{PD} patients, 54 {GBA}-{PD} patients) and a group of 174 {HCs}. Patients with sporadic {PD} and {GBA}-associated {PD} showed a significantly lower lymphocyte count, a non-significantly higher neutrophil count and a significantly higher {NLR} than {HCs}. The peripheral inflammatory immune response of patients with {LRRK}2-associated {PD} did not differ from {HCs}. Our study supports the involvement of a peripheral inflammatory immune response in the pathophysiology of {sPD} and {GBA}-associated {PD}. However, this inflammatory response was not found in {LRRK}2-associated {PD}, probably reflecting different pathogenic inflammatory mechanisms.},

Increasing extensive evidence supports the contribution of genetic risk variants and inflammation in the pathobiology of this disease. Functional and genetic studies demonstrate an overlap between genes linked to increased risk for {PD} and autoimmune diseases. Variants identified in loci adjacent to {LRRK}2, {GBA}, and {HLA} establish a crosstalk between the pathobiologies of the two disease spectra. Furthermore, common signalling pathways associated with the pathogenesis of genetic {PD} are also relevant to inflammatory signaling include {MAPK}, {NF}-κB, Wnt and inflammasome signaling. Importantly, post-mortem analyses of brain and cerebrospinal fluid from {PD} patients show the accumulation of proinflammatory cytokines.

The decrease in activity produced by the low dose had its onset within minutes after administration of the drug; persistent and marked hyperactivity was observed from about 60–80 min after injection of 0.5–8 mg/kg of quinpirole. Moreover, in animals injected with intermediate doses, the excitation was preceded by a brief period of reduced locomotion.

Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

Neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissues occurs in a well-defined stepwise manner, which includes elements of neutrophil rolling, firm adhesion, and crawling onto the endothelial cell surface before trans-migrating across the endothelial barrier. This latter step known as diapedesis can occur at the endothelial cell junction (paracellular) or directly through the endothelial cell body (transcellular). The extravasation cascade is controlled by series of engagement of various adhesive modules, which result in activation of bidirectional signals to neutrophils and endothelial cells for adequate cellular response. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of mechanism of leukocyte crawling and diapedesis, with an emphasis on leukocyte–endothelial interactions and the signaling pathways they transduce to determine the mode of diapedesis, junctional or non-junctional. I will also discuss emerging evidence highlighting key differences in the two modes of diapedesis and why it is clinically important to understand specificity in the regulation of diapedesis.},

	abstract = {The neutrophil transmigration across the blood endothelial cell barrier represents the prerequisite step of innate inflammation. Neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissues occurs in a well-defined stepwise manner, which includes elements of neutrophil rolling, firm adhesion, and crawling onto the endothelial cell surface before trans-migrating across the endothelial barrier. This latter step known as diapedesis can occur at the endothelial cell junction (paracellular) or directly through the endothelial cell body (transcellular). The extravasation cascade is controlled by series of engagement of various adhesive modules, which result in activation of bidirectional signals to neutrophils and endothelial cells for adequate cellular response. This review will focus on recent advances in our understanding of mechanism of leukocyte crawling and diapedesis, with an emphasis on leukocyte–endothelial interactions and the signaling pathways they transduce to determine the mode of diapedesis, junctional or non-junctional. I will also discuss emerging evidence highlighting key differences in the two modes of diapedesis and why it is clinically important to understand specificity in the regulation of diapedesis.},

	abstract = {{NETosis} is a regulated form of neutrophil cell death that contributes to the host defense against pathogens and was linked to various diseases soon after its first description in 2004. During {NETosis}, neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps ({NETs}), which can capture and kill bacteria and other pathogens to prevent them from spreading. Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of {NETosis}, the precise mechanism underlying {NETosis} is still a matter of debate. Research continues to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in {NETosis}. In recent years, interactions with the complement and coagulation systems have become increasingly apparent. Activated complement proteins can stimulate {NET} formation, and {NETs}, in turn, can serve as a platform for complement activation. In addition, {NETs} can act as a scaffold for thrombus formation during coagulation. While crosstalk between the coagulation and complement systems has been previously described, {NETosis} appears to be a third important player in this consortium to protect the host against pathogens. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the mutual interactions between {NETosis}, the complement system and the coagulation system, with an emerging description of their complex triangular relationship.},

Thus, fever during neutropenia warrants prompt empirical antibiotic therapy which should be active against the most frequent Gram-negatives. In the last decade, there has been a worldwide increase in multidrug resistant ({MDR}) strains. In these cases, the traditional choices such as oral therapy, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or even carbapenems, might be ineffective. Therefore novel de-escalation approach has been proposed for patients who are at high risk for infections due to {MDR} bacteria. It consists of starting antibiotics which cover the most probable resistant strain but it is narrowed down after 72 hours if no {MDR} pathogen is isolated. With increasing bacterial resistance, the benefit of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis during prolonged neutropenia remains to be confirmed. Antibiotic stewardship and infection control programs are mandatory in every cancer center.},

	abstract = {Dopamine is well recognized as a neurotransmitter in the brain, and
regulates critical functions in a variety of peripheral systems. Growing
research has also shown that dopamine acts as an important regulator of immune
function. Many immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopamine
related proteins, enabling them to actively respond to dopamine and suggesting
that dopaminergic immunoregulation is an important part of proper immune
function. A detailed understanding of the physiological concentrations of
dopamine in specific regions of the human body, particularly in peripheral
systems, is critical to the development of hypotheses and experiments examining
the effects of physiologically relevant dopamine concentrations on immune cells.
Unfortunately, the dopamine concentrations to which these immune cells would be
exposed in different anatomical regions are not clear. To address this issue,
this comprehensive review details the current information regarding
concentrations of dopamine found in both the central nervous system and in many
regions of the periphery. In addition, we discuss the immune cells present in
each region, and how these could interact with dopamine in each compartment
described. Finally, the review briefly addresses how changes in these dopamine
concentrations could influence immune cell dysfunction in several disease states
including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, as well as the collection of pathologies, cognitive
and motor symptoms associated with {HIV} infection in the central nervous system,
known as {NeuroHIV}. These data will improve our understanding of the interactions
between the dopaminergic and immune systems during both homeostatic function and
in disease, clarify the effects of existing dopaminergic drugs and promote the
creation of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulating immune function
through dopaminergic signaling.,},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPCs}) are regulated by signals from the marrow niche. Liu et al delineate a novel signalling pathway for {HSPCs} by which sympathetic nerve-derived dopamine regulates {HSPCs} by upregulating the kinase Lck, which in turn regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase modulation of stem cell factor signaling. This critical role for dopamine potentially could be exploited therapeutically to improve {HSPC} expansion following stem cell transplantation or recovery from marrow-suppressive insults., 
Dopamine signaling influences hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, {HSPC} proliferation, and transplantation efficiency.Dopamine maintains Lck expression to control stem cell factor–induced {ERK} signaling downstream of c-Kit.
, 
, Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ({HSPC}) function in bone marrow ({BM}) is controlled by stroma-derived signals, but the identity and interplay of these signals remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that sympathetic nerve–derived dopamine directly controls {HSPC} behavior through D2 subfamily dopamine receptors. Blockade of dopamine synthesis, as well as pharmacological or genetic inactivation of D2 subfamily dopamine receptors, leads to reduced {HSPC} frequency, inhibition of proliferation, and low {BM} transplantation efficiency. Conversely, treatment with a D2-type receptor agonist increases {BM} regeneration and transplantation efficiency. Mechanistically, dopamine controls expression of the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), which, in turn, regulates {MAPK}-mediated signaling triggered by stem cell factor in {HSPCs}. Our work reveals critical functional roles of dopamine in {HSPCs}, which may open up new therapeutic options for improved {BM} transplantation and other conditions requiring the rapid expansion of {HSPCs}.},

Cell fate decisions at the levels of proliferation and differentiation are enforced through expression of lineage-determining transcription factors and their interactions, which are influenced by intrinsic (intracellular) and extrinsic (extracellular) mechanisms. Neutrophil homeostasis is subjected to positive-feedback loops, stemming from the gut microbiome, as well as negative-feedback loops resulting from the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by mature macrophages.

This type of cell death (apoptosis), which physiologically occurs in the intrathymic process of immune cell selection, is usually evaluated by either electrophoretic or colorimetric methods which measure {DNA} fragmentation in the nuclear extracts. These techniques are unable to determine the percentage of apoptotic nuclei or recognize the apoptotic cells in a heterogeneous cell population. We have developed a flow cytometric method for measuring the percentage of apoptotic nuclei after propidium iodide staining in hypotonic buffer and have compared it with the classical colorimetric and electrophoretic techniques using dexamethasone ({DEX})-treated mouse thymocytes. Apoptotic nuclei appeared as a broad hypodiploid {DNA} peak which was easily discriminable from the narrow peak of thymocytes with normal (diploid) {DNA} content in the red fluorescence channels. When the {DEX}-induced apoptosis was inhibited by either low-temperature (4 degrees C) incubation or cycloheximide treatment, no hypodiploid {DNA} peak appeared. Similarly, thymocyte death induced by sodium azide, a substance with cell-killing activity through non-apoptotic mechanisms, did not result in any variation in the normal {DNA} peak. The flow cytometric data showed an excellent correlation with the results obtained with both electrophoretic and colorimetric methods. This new rapid, simple and reproducible method should prove useful for assessing apoptosis of specific cell populations in heterogeneous tissues such as bone marrow, thymus and lymph nodes.},

After many years of disappointing results, the tide has finally changed and immunotherapy has become a clinically validated treatment for many cancers. Immunotherapeutic strategies include cancer vaccines, oncolytic viruses, adoptive transfer of ex vivo activated T and natural killer cells, and administration of antibodies or recombinant proteins that either costimulate cells or block the so-called immune checkpoint pathways. The recent success of several immunotherapeutic regimes, such as monoclonal antibody blocking of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 ({CTLA}-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 ({PD}1), has boosted the development of this treatment modality, with the consequence that new therapeutic targets and schemes which combine various immunological agents are now being described at a breathtaking pace. In this review, we outline some of the main strategies in cancer immunotherapy (cancer vaccines, adoptive cellular immunotherapy, immune checkpoint blockade, and oncolytic viruses) and discuss the progress in the synergistic design of immune-targeting combination therapies.},

	abstract = {Dopamine ({DA}) is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues. Emerging evidence however points to {DA} also as a key transmitter between the nervous system and the immune system as well as a mediator produced and released by immune cells themselves. Dopaminergic pathways have received so far extensive attention in the adaptive branch of the immune system, where they play a role in health and disease such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and Parkinson's disease. Comparatively little is known about {DA} and the innate immune response, although {DA} may affect innate immune system cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. The present review aims at providing a complete and exhaustive summary of currently available evidence about {DA} and innate immunity, and to become a reference for anyone potentially interested in the fields of immunology, neurosciences and pharmacology. A wide array of dopaminergic drugs is used in therapeutics for non-immune indications, such as Parkinson's disease, hyperprolactinemia, shock, hypertension, with a usually favorable therapeutic index, and they might be relatively easily repurposed for immune-mediated disease, thus leading to innovative treatments at low price, with benefit for patients as well as for the healthcare systems.},

It is estimated that Parkinson disease affects at least 1\% of the population over the age of 60. The disorder is associated with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the presence of Lewy bodies. Most cases are idiopathic. Only about 10\% of cases have a genetic cause, and these cases are seen in young people. The disorder has a slow onset but is progressive. Tremor is often the first symptom and later can be associated with bradykinesia and rigidity. Postural instability is usually seen late in the disease and can seriously impact the quality of life. Also of importance is the presence of autonomic symptoms that may precede the motor symptoms in some patients. The diagnosis in most patients is based on history and clinical presentation. {SPECT} scans can be performed in doubtful cases or to rule out other neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by distinct aging-independent loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta ({SNpc}) region urging toward neuronal loss. Over the decade, various key findings from clinical perspective to molecular pathogenesis have aided in understanding the genetics with assorted genes related with {PD}. Subsequently, several pathways have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of {PD}, involving mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, and misfolding. On the other hand, the sporadic form of {PD} cases is found with no genetic linkage, which still remain an unanswered question? The exertion in ascertaining vulnerability factors in {PD} considering the genetic factors are to be further dissevered in the forthcoming decades with advancement in research studies. One of the major proponents behind the prognosis of {PD} is the pathogenic transmutation of aberrant alpha-synuclein protein into amyloid fibrillar structures, which actuates neurodegeneration. Alpha-synuclein, transcribed by {SNCA} gene is a neuroprotein found predominantly in brain. It is implicated in the modulation of synaptic vesicle transport and eventual release of neurotransmitters. Due to genetic mutations and other elusive factors, the alpha-synuclein misfolds into its amyloid form. Therefore, this review aims in briefing the molecular understanding of the alpha-synuclein associated with {PD}.},

First, pathogenic mutations increase the tendency of dardarin to form inclusion bodies. Secondly, neurons and neuronal cell lines undergo cell death after expression of mutant protein. Manipulating activity by replacing the kinase domain with a ‘kinase-dead’ version blocks inclusion body formation and strongly delays cell death. This predicts that kinase inhibitors will be useful therapeutic agents in patients with {LRRK}2 mutations and, perhaps, in sporadic {PD}.

Cleavage of {XTT} by dehydrogenase enzymes of metabolically active cells yields a highly colored formazan product which is water soluble. This feature obviates the need for formazan crystal solubilization prior to absorbance measurements, as required when using other tetrazolium salts such as {MTT}. Bioreduction of {XTT} by all the murine cells examined was not particularly efficient, but could be potentiated by addition of electron coupling agents such as phenazine methosulfate ({PMS}) or menadione ({MEN}). Optimal concentrations of {PMS} or {MEN} were determined for the metabolism of {XTT} by the T cell lines {HT}-2 and 11.6, {NFS}-60 a myeloid leukemia, {MC}/9 a mast cell line and mitogen activated splenic T cells. When used in combination with {PMS}, each of these cells generated higher formazan absorbance values with {XTT} than were observed with {MTT}. Thus the use of {XTT} in colorimetric proliferation assays offer significant advantages over {MTT}, resulting from reduced assay time and sample handling, while offering equivalent sensitivity.},

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) is a value obtained by dividing the absolute number of neutrophils by the absolute lymphocyte count and represents a biomarker of systemic inflammatory response. There are studies investigating {NLR} association with psychopathology. However, the relationship has been only studied in small numbers of patients with schizophrenia, which leads to conflicting results and makes the meta-analytic data difficult to interpret. The aim of this study is to perform large-scale cross-sectional analysis on the potential correlation between {NLR} and disease severity in schizophrenic patients with or without medication., Methods: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Brain Hospital. We identified inpatients with schizophrenia between July 12, 2018 and March 27, 2019 and collected data of {NLR}, the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale ({CGI}-S) score and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ({BPRS}) score., Results: The records of 1,144 identified patients (10.8\% drug-free patients) were analyzed. We found that {NLR} was significantly decreased in schizophrenic patients after antipsychotic administration and there was the discrepant correlation between {NLR} and psychiatric symptoms in patients with or without antipsychotic medication. The results of multivariate logistic regressions showed that {NLR} was positively associated with the severity of disease (i.e., the {CGI}-S score and the {BPRS} total score) in drug-free patients, and it was negatively associated with the {BPRS} negative symptoms (i.e., the {BPRS} negative symptoms score) in drug-therapy patients., Conclusion: The study is the first to confirm the hypothesis that {NLR} is independently associated with severe psychopathology in schizophrenia and is changed by antipsychotic administration.},

	abstract = {In this review we systematically assess our currently available knowledge about psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ({PNES}) with an emphasis on the psychological mechanisms that underlie {PNES}, possibilities for psychological treatment as well as prognosis. Relevant studies were identified by searching the electronic databases. Case reports were not considered. 93 papers were identified; 65 of which were studies. An open non-randomized design, comparing patients with {PNES} to patients with epilepsy is the dominant design. A working definition for {PNES} is proposed. With respect to psychological etiology, a heterogeneous set of factors have been identified. Not all factors have a similar impact, though. On the basis of this review we propose a model with several factors that may interact in both the development and prolongation of {PNES}. These factors involve psychological etiology, vulnerability, shaping, as well as triggering and prolongation factors. A necessary first step of intervention in patients with {PNES} seems to be explaining the diagnosis with care. Although the evidence for the efficacy of additional treatment strategies is limited, variants of cognitive (behavioural) therapy showed to be the preferred type of treatment for most patients. The exact choice of treatment should be based on individual differences in the underlying factors. Outcome can be measured in terms of seizure occurrence (frequency, severity), but other measures might be of greater importance for the patient. Prognosis is unclear but studies consistently report that 1/3rd to 1/4th of the patients become chronic.},

	abstract = {Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ({PNES}), also known as dissociative seizures, are paroxysms of altered subjective experience, involuntary movements and reduced self-control that can resemble epileptic seizures, but have distinct clinical characteristics and a complex neuropsychiatric aetiology. They are common, accounting for over 10\% of seizure emergencies and around 30\% of cases in tertiary epilepsy units, but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed. The recently proposed "integrative cognitive model" accommodates current research on experiential, psychological and biological risk factors for the development of {PNES}, but in view of the considerable heterogeneity of presentations and medical context, it is not certain that a universal model can capture the full range of {PNES} manifestations. This narrative review addresses key learning objectives of the {ILAE} curriculum by describing the demographic profile, common risk factors (such as trauma or acute stress) and comorbid disorders (such as other dissociative and functional disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive and anxiety disorders, personality disorders, comorbid epilepsy, head injury, cognitive and sleep problems, migraine, pain, and asthma).

	abstract = {Pseudoseizure is an older term for events that appear to be epileptic seizures but, in fact, do not represent the manifestation of abnormal excessive synchronous cortical activity, which defines epileptic seizures. They are not a variation of epilepsy but are of psychiatric origin. Other terms used in the past include hysterical seizures, psychogenic seizures, and others. The most standard current terminology is psychogenic nonepileptic seizures ({PNES}). Some advocate other terms such as psychogenic functional spells or psychogenic nonepileptic events, spells, or attacks. These terms reinforce the idea that the events are not epileptic seizures. A retrospective review of a small number of patients over a number of years revealed that dozens of different diagnostic terms were used to describe these events. Though established in use, the term pseudoseizure and others should be regarded as jargon, and the use of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (or alternatively, spells) ({PNES}) is encouraged for clarity.  Distinguishing {PNES} from epileptic seizures may be difficult at the bedside even to experienced observers. In theory, almost any recurrent behavior may represent epileptic seizures. The evolution of epilepsy monitoring units and the ability to utilize simultaneous video and {EEG} recordings may be a key to diagnosis. Video electroencephalography (video-{EEG}) of a typical event showing the absence of epileptiform activity during the spell with a compatible history is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis. Diagnostic delay of years with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures is common.  Treatment of {PNES} may be difficult, but it is clear that anti-epileptic drugs ({AEDs}) are of no benefit. In addition to unnecessary costs and the potential side effects of {AEDs} for these patients, life-threatening side effects such as respiratory depression may occur if psychogenic nonepileptic status epilepticus is treated with large dosages of benzodiazepines.},

	abstract = {Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures ({PNES}) are a functional neurological disorder/conversion disorder subtype, which are neurobehavioral conditions at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. Significant advancements over the past decade have been made in the diagnosis, management, and neurobiological understanding of {PNES}. This article reviews published {PNES} research focusing on semiologic features that distinguish {PNES} from epileptic seizures, consensus diagnostic criteria, the intersection of {PNES} and other comorbidities, neurobiological studies, evidence-based treatment interventions, and outcome studies. Epidemiology and healthcare utilization studies highlight a continued unmet medical need in the comprehensive care of {PNES}. Consensus guidelines for diagnostic certainty are based on clinical history, semiology of witnessed typical event(s), and {EEG} findings. While certain semiologic features may aid in the diagnosis of {PNES}, the gold standard remains capturing a typical event on video electroencephalography ({EEG}) showing the absence of epileptiform activity with history and semiology consistent with {PNES}. Medical-neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in {PNES}; these should be assessed in diagnostic evaluations and integrated into treatment interventions and prognostic considerations. Several studies, including a pilot, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, have now demonstrated that a cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for {PNES}, and additional efforts are necessary to evaluate the utility of pharmacologic and other psychotherapy treatments. Neuroimaging studies, while requiring replication, suggest that {PNES} may occur in the context of alterations within and across sensorimotor, emotion regulation/processing, cognitive control, and multimodal integration brain systems. Future research could investigate similarities and differences between {PNES} and other somatic symptom disorders.},

With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000 persons in the United States and a median age of 64 years, it is uncommon in children. The incidence is 1.6 times higher in males compared to females and 2.0 times higher in Caucasians compared to Africans and Afro-Americans, with lower incidence in Asians and American Indians. {GBM} is commonly located in the supratentorial region (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) and is rarely located in cerebellum. Genetic and environmental factors have been investigated in {GBM}. Risk factors include prior radiotherapy, decreased susceptibility to allergy, immune factors and immune genes, as well as some single nucleotide polymorphisms detected by genomic analysis. Use of anti-inflammatory medication has been found to be protective against {GBM}. Survival from {GBM} is poor; only few patients survive 2.5 years and less than 5\% of patients survive 5 years following diagnosis. Survival rates for patients with {GBM} have shown no notable improvement in population statistics in the last three decades. Molecular epidemiology integrates molecular technology into epidemiological studies and outcomes. The future of the epidemiology of {GBM} will depend on multicenter studies generating large clinical data sets of genomic data potentially leading to further understanding of the roles of genes and environment in the development of this devastating disease.},

We describe a patient who survived more than five years from the initial diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman presented to the emergency room for evaluation one day after a motor vehicle collision at the insistence of her husband, with four weeks of confusion, behavioral changes, and increased fatigue. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) of the brain revealed an enhancing, heterogeneous mass with significant necrosis, centered in the septum pellucidum and corpus callosum with intraventricular extension. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion. Pathology was consistent with glioblastoma, {WHO} grade {IV}. She underwent standard radiation treatment and adjuvant temozolomide, demonstrating a near-complete disappearance of the tumor on imaging for the subsequent two years. Upon recurrence, she underwent additional chemotherapy with limited response. A repeat biopsy was positive for a {BRAF} mutation and she was treated with lomustine. After two cycles, she developed thrombocytopenia and shortly after elected to discontinue treatment. She succumbed to the progression of disease five years and two months after the initial presentation. {bGBMs} are uncommon and highly aggressive brain tumors. A tailored treatment protocol may improve survival. This case marks an unusually long survival of a patient with {bGBM} and may prompt further research to better understand the behavior of these tumors and how to improve treatment response and survival.},

Several factors affect the mechanism of seizures in brain tumours, including tumour type, tumour location, and peritumoral and genetic changes. Prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs is not recommended, and potential interactions between antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic agents persuades against the use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Multidrug-resistance proteins prevent the access of antiepileptic drugs into brain parenchyma, which partly explains why seizures are frequently refractory to treatment. Lamotrigine, valproic acid, and topiramate are first-line treatments of choice; if insufficient, add-on treatment with levetiracetam or gabapentin can be recommended. On the basis of clinical studies, we prefer to start treatment with valproic acid, adding levetiracetam if necessary. Risks of cognitive side-effects with antiepileptic drugs can add to previous damage by surgery or radiotherapy, and therefore appropriate choice and dose of antiepileptic drug is crucial.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The available information on postictal semiology and behavior in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizure ({PNES}) is limited. In this study, we explore the differences in postictal semiology and behavior between patients with epileptic seizure ({ES}) and {PNES} and focus on clinical features that may be helpful in differentiating these two conditions.
{METHODS}: In this retrospective study, video-electroencephalograph (video-{EEG}) of 144 seizures from 64 patients with {PNES} and 66 seizures from 42 patients with {ES} were reviewed. Three novel postictal behaviors were compared between the two groups: a) abrupt, brief, and rapid blinking or shaking of the head as if regaining sensorium or "coming out" of the ictal event; b) looking around the room with a scanning and uncertain look; c) posing a question of "what happened?" or a similar question to the others present in the room. In addition, differences in several other postictal characteristics were studied.
{RESULTS}: At least one of the three specific postictal behaviors was seen in 20.1\% of patients with {PNES} but none of the patients with {ES} resulting in 100\% specificity and 36\% sensitivity. While mean ictal duration was significantly longer in patients with {PNES} (175.3 ± 168 s) compared to {ES} (105.4 ± 102.9 s), the interval between the end of ictal episode and first correct verbal response (74.5 ± 126.2 s versus 139.4 ± 185.4 s), or first followed command (84.1 ± 133.8 s versus 141.1 ± 192.1 s) were shorter. In the group with {PNES}, 59.7\% of patients demonstrated a whispering or altered voice during the first correct verbal response versus 21.2\% of patients in the group with {ES}. The first followed command was slow or erroneous in 49.3\% of the patients with {PNES} and in 19.7\% of the patients with {ES}.
{CONCLUSION}: In this study, we found significant differences between postictal semiology and behavior of patients with {PNES} and {ES} that can be helpful tools in distinguishing between these two conditions. Specifically, three novel postictal behaviors were studied and were found to have a high specificity, but low sensitivity, in distinguishing {PNES} from {ES}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Epileptic seizures ({ES}) lead to alterations in the blood laboratory values and reflect changes in different organ systems. Here, we review the diagnostic and prognostic value of various blood laboratory values within the context of epilepsy.
{METHODS}: Narrative review and literature search on {PubMed} using the term, "seizure" and various laboratory values.
{RESULTS}: Laboratory markers can help clinicians determine whether an unwitnessed event was more likely to be epileptic or non-epileptic. Prolactin testing helps differentiate {ES} from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ({PNES}) in adults and adolescents, and is associated with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Elevations in the creatine kinase ({CK}) levels are common after generalized tonic-clonic seizures ({GTCS}) and display high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Metabolic markers such as ammonia and lactate may have diagnostic potential for postictal blood tests. Analyzing blood postictally is important for identifying the cause of the symptomatic seizures due to endocrine, metabolic, toxic or infectious etiologies. Finally, laboratory analyses are used for identifying patients who are at risk for developing rare, threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure ({ARF}) or cardiomyopathy.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Presently, no postictal laboratory values can definitively prove or rule out the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. For seizures with unknown causes, simple blood tests can be a valuable aid for quickly defining the etiology, particularly with certain metabolic and toxic encephalopathies. For this reason, {CK}, electrolytes, creatinine, liver and renal function tests should be measured on at least one occasion. Further research is needed in order to identify new biomarkers that improve the diagnosis and prognosis of seizures and seizure-related complications.},

Those with past history of psychiatric illnesses were excluded. {VEEG}, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation were performed. Patients in Group I (07) were treated with psychotherapy, psychiatric medications and immediate withdrawal of {LEV} while, those in Group {II} (06) received psychotherapy, anxiolytics and {LEV} for initial 2 months after which it was stopped. Follow-up period was six months. There was subsidence of {PNES} on discontinuation of {LEV} in these patients.   Results Mean (±{SD}) age of patients was 25 ± 12.28 years; there were 11 (84.62\%) females. All were on antiepileptic agents which included {LEV} {\textgreater}1000 mg/day, except one. Mean dose of {LEV} was 1269.23 ± 483.71 mg/day. Three patient's scores were suggestive of depression or anxiety; one had both depression and anxiety. Eight patients had mood disorders; three had a history of emotional abuse or neglect. {PNES} subsided within 1-3 months and did not recur after withdrawal of {LEV} in any patient.   Conclusion {LEV} can induce {PNES} in susceptible populations. Awareness of this association is crucial for timely withdrawal of triggering factor and appropriate management. This will reduce inadvertent additional prescription of antiepileptic agents.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To determine the duration of epileptic seizure types in patients who did not undergo withdrawal of antiseizure medication.
{METHODS}: From a large, structured database of 11 919 consecutive, routine video-electroencephalograpy ({EEG}) recordings, labeled using the {SCORE} (Standardized Computer-Based Organized Reporting of {EEG}) system, we extracted and analyzed 2742 seizures. For each seizure type we determined median duration and range after removal of outliers (2.5-97.5 percentile). We used surface electromyography ({EMG}) for accurate measurement of short motor seizures.
{RESULTS}: Myoclonic seizures last {\textless}150 ms, epileptic spasms 0.4-2 s, tonic seizures 1.5-36 s, atonic seizures 0.1-12,5 s, when measured using surface {EMG}. Generalized clonic seizures last 1-24 s. Typical absence seizures are rarely longer than 30 s (2.75-26.5 s) and atypical absences last 2-100 s. In our patients, the duration of focal aware (median: 27 s; 1.25-166 s) and impaired awareness seizures (median: 42.5 s; 9.5-271 s) was shorter than reported previously in patients undergoing withdrawal of antiseizure medication. All focal seizures terminated within 10 min. Median duration of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 79.5 s (57-102 s) and of focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures was 103.5 (77.5-237 s). All tonic-clonic seizures terminated within 5 min.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: This comprehensive list of seizure durations provides important information for characterizing seizures and diagnosing patients with epilepsy. The upper limits of seizure durations are helpful in early recognition of imminent status epilepticus.},

	abstract = {Significance: The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is conserved from worms to humans and plays a critical role in the normal development and homeostatic control of adult tissues. As a result, numerous diseases from cancer to neurodegeneration are associated with either too little or too much apoptosis. Recent Advances: B cell lymphoma-2 ({BCL}-2) family members regulate cell death, primarily via their effects on mitochondria. In stressed cells, proapoptotic {BCL}-2 family members promote mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization ({MOMP}) and cytochrome c (cyt c) release into the cytoplasm, where it stimulates formation of the “apoptosome.” This large, multimeric complex is composed of the adapter protein, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1, and the cysteine protease, caspase-9. Recent studies suggest that proteins involved in the processes leading up to (and including) formation of the apoptosome are subject to various forms of post-translational modification, including proteolysis, phosphorylation, and in some cases, direct oxidative modification. Critical Issues: Despite intense investigation of the intrinsic pathway, significant questions remain regarding how cyt c is released from mitochondria, how the apoptosome is formed and regulated, and how caspase-9 is activated within the complex. Future Directions: Further studies on the biochemistry of {MOMP} and apoptosome formation are needed to understand the mechanisms that underpin these critical processes, and novel animal models will be necessary in the future to ascertain the importance of the many posttranslational modifications reported for {BCL}-2 family members and components of the apoptosome.

More recently, the dopamine D1 receptor has been hypothesized to be a promising target for the treatment of negative and/or cognitive aspects of schizophrenia that are not improved by current antipsychotics. Although {cAMP} has been presumed to be the primary messenger for signaling through the dopamine receptors, the last decade has unveiled a complexity that has provided exciting avenues for the future discovery of antipsychotic drugs ({APDs}). We review the signaling mechanisms of currently approved {APDs} at dopamine D2 receptors, and note that aripiprazole is a compound that is clearly differentiated from other approved drugs. Although aripiprazole has been postulated to cause dopamine stabilization due to its partial D2 agonist properties, a body of literature suggests that an alternate mechanism, functional selectivity, is of primary importance. Finally, we review the signaling at dopamine D1 receptors, and the idea that drugs that activate D1 receptors may have use as {APDs} for improving negative and cognitive symptoms. We address the current state of drug discovery in the D1 area, and its relationship to novel signaling mechanisms. Our conclusion is that although the first {APD} targeting dopamine receptors was discovered more than a half-century ago, recent research advances offer the possibility that novel and/or improved drugs will emerge in the next decade.},

	abstract = {The {CXC} chemokine {CXCL}12 is an important factor in physiological and pathological processes, including embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and inflammation, because it activates and/or induces migration of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, endothelial cells and most leukocytes. Therefore, {CXCL}12 activity is tightly regulated at multiple levels. {CXCL}12 has the unique property of existing in six splice variants in humans, each having a specific tissue distribution and in vivo activity. Controlled splice variant transcription and {mRNA} stability determine the {CXCL}12 expression profile. {CXCL}12 fulfills its functions in homeostatic and pathological conditions by interacting with its receptors {CXC} chemokine receptor 4 ({CXCR}4) and atypical chemokine receptor 3 ({ACKR}3) and by binding to glycosaminoglycans ({GAGs}) in tissues and on the endothelium to allow a proper presentation to passing leukocytes. Homodimerizaton and heterodimerization of {CXCL}12 and its receptors can alter their signaling activity, as exemplified by the synergy between {CXCL}12 and other chemokines in leukocyte migration assays. Receptor binding may also initiate {CXCL}12 internalization and its subsequent removal from the environment. Furthermore, {CXCL}12 activity is regulated by posttranslational modifications. Proteolytic removal of {NH}2- or {COOH}-terminal amino acids, citrullination of arginine residues by peptidyl arginine deiminases or nitration of tyrosine residues reduce {CXCL}12 activity. This review summarizes the interactions of {CXCL}12 with the cellular environment and discusses the different levels of {CXCL}12 activity regulation.},

	abstract = {Pain is associated with most bony pathologies. Clinical and experimental observations suggest that bone pain can be derived from noxious stimulation of the periosteum or bone marrow. Sensory neurons are known to innervate the periosteum and marrow cavity, and most of these have a morphology and molecular phenotype consistent with a role in nociception. However, little is known about the physiology of these neurons, and therefore information about mechanisms that generate and maintain bone pain is lacking. The periosteum has received greater attention relative to the bone marrow, reflecting the easier access of the periosteum for experimental assessment. With the electrophysiological preparations used, investigators have been able to record from single periosteal units in isolation, and there is a lot of information available about how they respond to different stimuli, including those that are noxious. In contrast, preparations used to study sensory neurons that innervate the bone marrow have been limited to recording multi-unit activity in whole nerves, and whilst they clearly report responses to noxious stimulation, it is not possible to define responses for single sensory neurons that innervate the bone marrow. There is only limited evidence that peripheral sensory neurons that innervate bone can be sensitized or that they can be activated by multiple stimulus types, and at present this only exists in part for periosteal units. In the central nervous system, it is clear that spinal dorsal horn neurons can be activated by noxious stimuli applied to bone. Some can be sensitized under pathological conditions and may contribute in part to secondary or referred pain associated with bony pathology. Activity related to stimulation of sensory nerves that innervate bone has also been reported in neurons of the spinoparabrachial pathway and the somatosensory cortices, both known for roles in coding information about pain. Whilst these provide some clues as to the way information about bone pain is centrally coded, they need to be expanded to further our understanding of other central territories involved. There is a lot more to learn about the physiology of peripheral sensory neurons that innervate bone and their central projections.},

	abstract = {The innervation of bone has been described for centuries, and our understanding of its function has rapidly evolved over the past several decades to encompass roles of subtype‐specific neurons in skeletal homeostasis. Current research has been largely focused on the distribution and function of specific neuronal populations within bone, as well as their cellular and molecular relationships with target cells in the bone microenvironment. This review provides a historical perspective of the field of skeletal neurobiology that highlights the diverse yet interconnected nature of nerves and skeletal health, particularly in the context of bone anabolism and pain. We explore what is known regarding the neuronal subtypes found in the skeleton, their distribution within bone compartments, and their central projection pathways. This neuroskeletal map then serves as a foundation for a comprehensive discussion of the neural control of skeletal development, homeostasis, repair, and bone pain. Active synthesis of this research recently led to the first biotherapeutic success story in the field. Specifically, the ongoing clinical trials of anti‐nerve growth factor therapeutics have been optimized to titrated doses that effectively alleviate pain while maintaining bone and joint health. Continued collaborations between neuroscientists and bone biologists are needed to build on this progress, leading to a more complete understanding of neural regulation of the skeleton and development of novel therapeutics. © 2019 The Authors.

In total, sensory innervation functions in bone much as it does elsewhere in the body—to sense and respond to stimuli, including mechanical loading. Similarly, sympathetic nerves regulate autonomic functions related to bone, including homeostatic remodeling and vascular tone. However, more study is required to translate our current knowledge of bone-nerve crosstalk to novel therapeutic strategies that can be effectively utilized to combat skeletal diseases, disorders of low bone mass, and age-related decreases in bone quality.},

Animal studies concluded that sensory myelinated A∂-fibers and unmyelinated C-fibers are mainly responsible for conducting bone pain, and that the innervation density of these nerve fibers was highest in periosteum. However, literature regarding sensory innervation of human bone is scarce. This observational study aimed to quantify sensory nerve fiber density in periosteum, cortical bone, and bone marrow of axial and appendicular human bones using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Multivariate Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that the total number of sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers was highest in periosteum, followed by bone marrow, and cortical bone for all bones studied. Bone from thoracic vertebral bodies contained most sensory nerve fibers, followed by the upper extremity, lower extremity, and parietal neurocranium. The number of nerve fibers declined with age and did not differ between male and female specimens. Sensory nerve fibers were organized as a branched network throughout the periosteum. The current results provide an explanation for the severe pain accompanying skeletal disease, fracture, or surgery. Further, the results could provide more insight into mechanisms that generate and maintain skeletal pain and might aid in developing new treatment strategies.

	abstract = {To coordinate specialized organs, inter-tissue communication appeared during evolution. Consequently, individual organs communicate their states via a vast interorgan communication network ({ICN}) made up of peptides, proteins, and metabolites that act between organs to coordinate cellular processes under homeostasis and stress. However, the nature of the interorgan signaling could be even more complex and involve mobilization mechanisms of unconventional cells that are still poorly described. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells ({MSCs}) virtually reside in all tissues, though the biggest reservoir discovered so far is adipose tissue where they are named adipose stromal cells ({ASCs}). {MSCs} are thought to participate in tissue maintenance and repair since the administration of exogenous {MSCs} is well known to exert beneficial effects under several pathological conditions. However, the role of endogenous {MSCs} is barely understood. Though largely debated, the presence of circulating endogenous {MSCs} has been reported in multiple pathophysiological conditions, but the significance of such cell circulation is not known and therapeutically untapped. In this review, we discuss current knowledge on the circulation of native {MSCs}, and we highlight recent findings describing {MSCs} as putative key components of the {ICN}.},

	abstract = {Santiago Ramón y Cajal described a number of somatosensory structures, including several associated with pain, in his major work on the Histology of the Nervous System of Man and Vertebrates. Our knowledge of such structures has been considerably expanded since Cajal because of the introduction of a number of experimental approaches that were not available in his time. For example, Cajal made several drawings of peripheral mechanoreceptors, as well as of bare nerve endings, but later work by others described additional somatosensory receptors and investigated the ultrastructure of bare nerve endings. Furthermore, the transducer molecules responsible for responses to nociceptive, thermal or chemical stimuli are now becoming known, including a series of {TRP} (transient receptor potential) receptor molecules, such as {TRPV}1 (the capsaicin receptor). Cajal described the development of dorsal root and other sensory ganglion cells and related the disposition of their somata and neurites to his theory of the functional polarity of neurons. He described the entry of both large and small afferent fibers into the spinal cord, including the projections of their collaterals into different parts of the gray matter and into different white matter tracts. He described a number of types of neurons in the gray matter, including ones in the marginal zone, substantia gelatinosa and head and neck of the dorsal horn. He found neurons in the deep dorsal horn whose dendrites extend dorsally into the superficial dorsal horn. Some of these neurons have since been shown by retrograde labeling to be spinothalamic tract cells. Cajal clearly described the dorsal column/medial lemniscus pathway, but the presence and course of the spinothalamic tract was unknown at the time.},

Although many of the trials were designed with the highest of standards, recent evidence suggests that factors related to {TENS} application need to be considered in an assessment of efficacy. These factors include dosing of {TENS}, negative interactions with long-term opioid use, the population and outcome assessed, timing of outcome measurement, and comparison groups.

Sequestration of {HSPCs} in bone marrow after {SCI} is linked to aberrant chemotactic signaling that can be reversed by post-injury injections of Plerixafor ({AMD}3100), a small molecule inhibitor of {CXCR}4. Even though Plerixafor liberates {HSPCs} and mature immune cells from bone marrow, competitive repopulation assays show that the intrinsic long-term functional capacity of {HSPCs} is still impaired in {SCI} mice.

Recent studies, by using state-of-the-art methodologies, including sophisticated in vivo inducible genetic techniques, such as lineage-tracing Cre/{loxP} mediated systems, in combination with pharmacological inhibition, provide evidence that sensory neuron is an important component of the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell niche. Strikingly, knockout of a specific receptor in sensory neurons blocked stem cell function in the bone marrow. The knowledge arising from these discoveries will be crucial for stem cell manipulation in the future.

Neutrophils also participate as mediators of inflammation. The classical view for these leukocytes is that neutrophils constitute a homogenous population of terminally differentiated cells with a unique function. However, evidence accumulated in recent years, has revealed that neutrophils present a large phenotypic heterogeneity and functional versatility, which place neutrophils as important modulators of both inflammation and immune responses. Indeed, the roles played by neutrophils in homeostatic conditions as well as in pathological inflammation and immune processes are the focus of a renovated interest in neutrophil biology. In this review, I present the concept of neutrophil phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and describe several neutrophil subpopulations reported to date. I also discuss the role these subpopulations seem to play in homeostasis and disease.},

Failure to carry out this role leads to immunodeficiency, which is mainly characterized by the presence of recurrent infections. Defects in neutrophil function can be quantitative, as seen in neutropenia or qualitative, as seen in neutrophil dysfunction. The standard circulating neutrophil count is above 1.5 x 10/L. Neutropenia can be classified in asymptomatic (mild), moderate, and severe, and thus, the progression to infection concerning the number. Neutropenia, with decreased production with marrow hypoplasia, can be primary and due to chronic benign neutropenia, cyclical neutropenia, and other congenital and familial neutropenias. It can be secondary to cytotoxic drugs, aplastic anemia, leukemia, drug reactions, and infections. Neutropenia, with increased destruction with marrow hyperplasia, is due to hypersplenism and immune neutropenia. Secondary causes are the commonest. For example, neutropenia caused as a side effect of chemotherapy for malignancies. Congenital forms are rare and vary in severity; some of them are life-threatening conditions including leukocyte adhesion deficiency, Chediak-Higashi syndrome, hyper-{IgE}, recurrent infection syndrome, and chronic granulomatous disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: For the normal resolution of an acute inflammatory response, neutrophil ({PMN}) apoptosis is essential to maintain immune homeostasis and to limit inappropriate host tissue damage. A delay in {PMN} apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({SIRS}). Dopamine, a biogenic amine with known cardiovascular and neurotransmitter properties, is used in patients with {SIRS} to maintain hemodynamic stability. We sought to determine whether dopamine may also have immunoregulatory properties capable of influencing {PMN} apoptosis, function, and activation state in patients with {SIRS}.
{METHODS}: {PMNs} were isolated from healthy volunteers and patients with {SIRS} and treated with varying doses of dopamine and a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam. {PMN} apoptosis was assessed every 6 hours with use of propidium iodide {DNA} staining and {PMN} function was assessed with use of respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis ability, and {CD}11a, {CD}11b, and {CD}18 receptor expression as functional markers.
{RESULTS}: There was a significant delay in {PMN} apotosis in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment of isolated {PMNs} from both healthy controls and patients with {SIRS} with 10 and 100 mumol/L dopamine induced apoptosis. {PMN} ingestive and cytocidal capacity were both decreased in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment with dopamine significantly increased phagocytic function. Fenoldopam did not induce {PMN} apoptosis.
{CONCLUSION}: Our data demonstrate for the first time that dopamine induces {PMN} apoptosis and modulates {PMN} function both in healthy controls and in patients with {SIRS}. These results indicate that dopamine may be beneficial during {SIRS} through a nonhemodynamic {PMN}-dependent proapoptotic mechanism.},

Four frequently used flow cytometric techniques were evaluated: (i) Annexin V/Propidium Iodide assay, detecting the translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, simultaneously with preservation of the membrane integrity; (ii) Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase ({TdT}) Uridine triphosphate ({UTP}) nick end labelling ({TUNEL}), revealing the presence of {DNA} strand breaks; (iii) {DNA}-flow cytometry, measuring {DNA}-stainability ({DNA}-fragmentation assay) and (iv) Phycoerythrin-labelled ({PE}) Apo2.7-assay, a monoclonal antibody against 7A6 antigen, a protein, which becomes exposed upon the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis. As a general standard for identifying that apoptosis had occurred, the cells were assessed for the presence of {DNA}-laddering on agar gel electrophoresis and by demonstration of characteristic cell morphology. Results were as follows: Fluorescein Isothiocyanate ({FITC})-labelled Annexin V/Propidium iodide flow cytometry appeared to be the most sensitive, the most specific and the most user-friendly test for measurement of apoptosis of cells in culture conditions in suspension. The expression of 7A6 antigen on the mitochondrial membrane appeared to be not specific for apoptotic cell death.},

The neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) is a simple and easily accessible indicator of the systemic inflammatory response. Our goal was to investigate whether {NLR} was higher in patients with schizophrenia than in healthy comparison subjects similar in age, sex, and body mass index.

          Signatures of immune dysregulation as clinical biomarker for psychosis have remained unclear. We aimed to compare the Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) of patients with acute non-affective first-episode psychosis ({FEP}) with healthy controls after accounting for emotional states, and explore their associations with symptom severity, onset profile and cognitive functions. The {NLR} was enumerated from complete blood count taken within a week of assessment. All {FEP} patients were assessed with Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PANSS}) and the Clinician Global Impression-Severity ({CGI}-S) scores. Verbal memory and executive functions were assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery. Prevailing emotional state was measured with Beck Depression Inventory-{II} and Beck Anxiety Inventory. 27 eligible subjects screened out of 79 consecutive {FEP} patients with their age-/sex-matched controls were recruited. The {FEP} patients had an {NLR} of 1.886 higher than controls after accounting for emotional states. The {NLR} of {FEP} patients was positively associated with {PANSS} positive symptom, disorganization and excitation scores, as well as {CGI}-S scores. There was no significant correlation between {NLR} with duration of untreated psychosis and cognitive performances. These findings support using {NLR} as clinical biomarker in {FEP}, purporting further prospective study to measure {NLR} changes in the course of treatment.},

A socio-demographic information form was filled out by the clinician. Height, body weight, waist and hip circumference and blood pressure values of each patient were measured. Severity of disease was assessed by positive and negative syndrome scale ({PANSS}) and clinical global impression-severity scale ({CGI}-S). Complete blood count was performed to both patient and control groups. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, {HbA}1c, low-density lipoprotein ({LDL}), high-density lipoprotein ({HDL}), triglyceride, total cholesterol and C-reactive protein ({CRP}) were measured.Results: The number of leukocytes, neutrophils, monocytes and {NLR} values in patients with schizophrenia was significantly higher than in the control group. There was no significant relationship between {NLR} values and the number of hospitalisation, duration of ilness or disease severity in patients. There was no correlation between other laboratory findings and {NLR} values.Conclusion: {NLR} levels are high in schizophrenia independent of metabolic parameters according to the results. So, it can be considered that inflammatory processes may play a role in the etiology of the disease.},

	abstract = {{NADPH} oxidases ({NOXs}) constitute a family of enzymes generating reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and are increasingly recognized as interesting drug targets. Here we investigated the effects of 10 phenothiazine compounds on {NOX} activity using an extensive panel of assays to measure production of {ROS} (Amplex red, {WST}-1, {MCLA}) and oxygen consumption. Striking differences between highly similar phenothiazines were observed. Two phenothiazines without N-substitution, including {ML}171, did not inhibit {NOX} enzymes, but showed assay interference. Introduction of an aliphatic amine chain on the N atom of the phenothiazine B ring (promazine) conferred inhibitory activity toward {NOX}2, {NOX}4, and {NOX}5 but not {NOX}1 and {NOX}3. Addition of an electron-attracting substituent in position 2 of the C ring extended the inhibitory activity to {NOX}1 and {NOX}3, with thioridazine being the most potent inhibitor. In contrast, the presence of a methylsulfoxide group at the same position (mesoridazine) entirely abolished {NOXinhibitory} activity. A cell-free {NOX}2 assay suggested that inhibition by N-substituted phenothiazines was not due to competition with {NADPH}. A functional implication of {NOX}-inhibitory activity of thioridazine was demonstrated by its ability to block redox-dependent myoﬁbroblast differentiation. Our results demonstrate that {NOX}-inhibitory activity is not a common feature of all antipsychotic phenothiazines and that substitution on the B-ring nitrogen is crucial for the activity, whereas that on the second position of the C ring modulates it. Our ﬁndings contribute to a better understanding of {NOX} pharmacology and might pave the path to discovery of more potent and selective {NOX} inhibitors.},

	shorttitle = {Is Elevated Neutrophil Count and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio a Cause or Consequence of Schizophrenia?},
	abstract = {Background: Several studies have found an association between elevated neutrophil count or neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) in peripheral blood from patients with schizophrenia. The etiology behind this effect is unknown, and it is unclear if changes in neutrophil count and {NLR} may be induced by antipsychotics or if these parameters relate to the diagnosis and symptoms of schizophrenia. The purpose of this scoping review was to map research that explores this association, and to identify gaps in the current knowledge base.
Method: The work was conducted in accordance with established methodological standards for scoping reviews. Studies on neutrophil count and {NLR} in schizophrenia were identified through search in relevant databases, and a parallel screening procedure was performed to ensure validity and reproducibility of the search. Articles that included different comparison groups, with differences in medication status (drug-naïve or drug-free vs. medicated), current disease state (relapse vs. remission), or treatment response, were included, as well as studies evaluating the association between symptomatology and neutrophil count or {NLR}.
Results: The available literature was limited with substantial differences in aims, methods, and outcomes. In total, 13 articles were included for the synthesis of this review. Some interesting trends were identified: Neutrophil count and {NLR} seem to be elevated in schizophrenia patients regardless of current or past use of antipsychotic therapy. Neutrophil count and {NLR} correlated significantly with positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Still, these findings should be interpreted with caution due to considerable methodological differences and weaknesses in the literature, particularly concerning the blood sampling procedure.
Conclusion: By including longitudinal studies and by comparing patient groups based on medication status, disease state and response, our study provides a basis for dissecting the associations between increased neutrophil count or {NLR} and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Further research should investigate and quantify the apparent strong correlation between neutrophil count or {NLR} and positive symptoms in schizophrenia, to evaluate its clinical potential to guide diagnostics, treatment, or as a predictor of outcome. This review also exposes important methodological weaknesses in the literature on neutrophil count and {NLR} measurements. Standardization of blood sampling and processing is crucial to reduce bias, and factors that are known to influence leukocyte levels need to be accounted for.},

Reduced cancer risk has been correlated with disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, in which dopaminergic drugs are used. D2R antagonists are reported to have anticancer efficacy in cell culture and animal models where they have reduced tumor growth, induced autophagy, affected lipid metabolism, and caused apoptosis, among other effects. This has led to several hypotheses, the most prevalent being that D2R ligands may be a novel approach to cancer chemotherapy. This hypothesis is appealing because of the large number of approved and experimental drugs of this class that could be repurposed. We review the current state of the literature and the evidence for and against this hypothesis. When the existing literature is evaluated from a pharmacological context, one of the striking findings is that the concentrations needed for cytotoxic effects of D2R antagonists are orders of magnitude higher than their affinity for this receptor. Although additional definitive studies will provide further clarity, our hypothesis is that targeting D2-like dopamine receptors may only yield useful ligands for cancer chemotherapy in rare cases.},

A total of 487 incident cases of {PD} without preceding cancer were identified by self-report. Each {PD} case was matched by age to a reference participant who was alive and cancer free at the time of {PD} diagnosis. Both cohorts were followed for incident cancer. We used proportional hazards models to calculate adjusted relative risks ({RR}) for cancer.Results: A total of 121 cancers were confirmed during a median follow-up of 5.2 years ({PD}) and 5.9 years (reference). Those with {PD} developed less cancer (11.0\% versus 14.0\%), with an adjusted {RR} of 0.85 [95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI}), 0.59-1.22]. Reduced risk was present for smoking-related cancers such as lung ({RR}, 0.32), colorectal ({RR}, 0.54), and bladder ({RR}, 0.68), as well as for most non–smoking-related cancers such as prostate cancer ({RR}, 0.74). In contrast, {PD} patients were at significantly increased risk ({RR}, 6.15; 95\% {CI}, 1.77-21.37) for melanoma. {PD} patients who smoked were at reduced risk for smoking-related cancer ({RR}, 0.33; 95\% {CI}, 0.12-0.92), whereas nonsmokers with {PD} were at increased risk ({RR}, 1.80; 95\% {CI}, 0.60-5.39). This interaction was statistically significant (Pinteraction = 0.02).Conclusions: Our results suggest a decreased incidence of most cancers in patients with {PD}. {PD} patients had a significantly increased risk of malignant melanoma, a finding consistent with prior studies. We confirmed an interaction between smoking and the relationship of {PD} to smoking-related cancer that may fit the pattern of a gene-environment interaction.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The incidence of cancer in patients with schizophrenia has been conversely reported to be higher, lower, or similar to that in the general population. The effects of lifestyle factors such as excess smoking, exposure to neuroleptic medications, and genetic factors that may influence the incidence of cancer in this group are not clear. The current study was performed to evaluate the frequency of cancer in a large cohort of patients with schizophrenia and to determine the standardized incidence ratios ({SIRs}) of any malignancy in this group.
{METHODS}: Data regarding the design, setting, and participants of the current study were analyzed from a cohort of 3226 patients with schizophrenia who were enrolled in the computerized health registry of the Abarbanel Mental Health Center between 1993-2003. The mean age of the patients at the time of the diagnosis of cancer was 49 +/- 14.7 years, with the majority of patients (61\%) being male. All patients with schizophrenia records in the database were combined with the records of the Israeli National Cancer Registry to identify pathologically confirmed cancer comorbidity. The cancer incidence rates among patients with schizophrenia were compared with the expected incidence in an age-matched and gender-matched general population sample for the same time interval.
{RESULTS}: Among 1247 female patients with schizophrenia, 22 (1.8\%) developed breast cancer and 68 (5.5\%) developed cancers of any type. Fifty-two of the 1979 male schizophrenic patients (2.6\%) developed cancer. The {SIRs} were 0.58 (95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI}], 0.48-0.69) with a P value of {\textless} 0.05 for all cancers in the cohort, and 0.60 (95\% {CI}, 0.37-0.90) for female breast cancer.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results of the current study demonstrate a reduced risk of cancer in patients with schizophrenia. The mechanisms responsible for the lower risk need be investigated further.},

	abstract = {T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-{ALL}) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in {NOTCH}1 and dysregulation of {MYC}. Here, we performed 2 complementary screens to identify {FDA}-approved drugs and drug-like small molecules with activity against T-{ALL}. We developed a zebrafish system to screen small molecules for toxic activity toward {MYC}-overexpressing thymocytes and used a human T-{ALL} cell line to screen for small molecules that synergize with Notch inhibitors. We identified the antipsychotic drug perphenazine in both screens due to its ability to induce apoptosis in fish, mouse, and human T-{ALL} cells. Using ligand-affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, we identified protein phosphatase 2A ({PP}2A) as a perphenazine target. T-{ALL} cell lines treated with perphenazine exhibited rapid dephosphorylation of multiple {PP}2A substrates and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, {shRNA} knockdown of specific {PP}2A subunits attenuated perphenazine activity, indicating that {PP}2A mediates the drug's antileukemic activity. Finally, human T-{ALLs} treated with perphenazine exhibited suppressed cell growth and dephosphorylation of {PP}2A targets in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the recurring identification of phenothiazines as a class of drugs with anticancer effects. Furthermore, these data suggest that pharmacologic {PP}2A activation in T-{ALL} and other cancers driven by hyperphosphorylated {PP}2A substrates has therapeutic potential.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Dopamine receptor D2 ({DRD}2) is a G protein-coupled receptor antagonized by {ONC}201, an anticancer small molecule in clinical trials for high-grade gliomas and other malignancies. {DRD}5 is a dopamine receptor family member that opposes {DRD}2 signaling. We investigated the expression of these dopamine receptors in cancer and their influence on tumor cell sensitivity to {ONC}201.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to determine {DRD}2/{DRD}5 expression broadly across human cancers. Cell viability assays were performed with {ONC}201 in {\textgreater}1,000 Genomic of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and {NCI}60 cell lines. {IHC} staining of {DRD}2/{DRD}5 was performed on tissue microarrays and archival tumor tissues of glioblastoma patients treated with {ONC}201. Whole exome sequencing was performed in {RKO} cells with and without acquired {ONC}201 resistance. Wild-type and mutant {DRD}5 constructs were generated for overexpression studies.
{RESULTS}: {DRD}2 overexpression broadly occurs across tumor types and is associated with a poor prognosis. Whole exome sequencing of cancer cells with acquired resistance to {ONC}201 revealed a de novo Q366R mutation in the {DRD}5 gene. Expression of Q366R {DRD}5 was sufficient to induce tumor cell apoptosis, consistent with a gain-of-function. {DRD}5 overexpression in glioblastoma cells enhanced {DRD}2/{DRD}5 heterodimers and {DRD}5 expression was inversely correlated with innate tumor cell sensitivity to {ONC}201. Investigation of archival tumor samples from patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with {ONC}201 revealed that low {DRD}5 expression was associated with relatively superior clinical outcomes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These results implicate {DRD}5 as a negative regulator of {DRD}2 signaling and tumor sensitivity to {ONC}201 {DRD}2 antagonism.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of phenothiazines (at clinically relevant doses) on the viability and proliferation of leukemic cell lines and normal lymphocytes, and to investigate the possibility of specific induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells.
{METHODS}: Phenothiazines with different chemical structure and hydrophobicity were used: chlorpromazine ({CPZ}); levomepromazine ({LVPZ}); prometazine ({PMZ}); trifluoperazine ({TFPZ}); thioridazine ({TRDZ}). The leukemic cell lines used were: Daudi and Raji (derived from Burkitt's lymphoma), K-562 (derived from myelogenous leukemia), and {BALL}-1, {MOLT}-4, {HPB}-{ALL} and {CCRF}-{HSB}-2 (derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia). The cytotoxicity of the phenothiazines was determined by a {CellTiter}-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, using {ATP} bioluminescence as a marker of cell viability as well as a marker of mitochondrial activity. The proliferation of leukemic cells was determined using a {CellTiter}-{AQ} cell proliferation assay which is based on the reduction of a methyl-tetrazolium compound to the formazan product. Apoptosis induction was estimated using phosphatidylserine ({PSer}) translocation to the cell surface and {DNA} fragmentation as characteristics of the process.
{RESULTS}: Phenothiazines (at concentrations in the range 0.1-10 micro M) did not affect the viability of normal lymphocytes during a 24-h incubation. Moreover, about 15-20\% increase in {ATP} bioluminescence was observed in normal cells during treatment with 40 micro M phenothiazines. In contrast, the phenothiazines manifested strong cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity against leukemic cells. The most powerful drugs were {TFPZ} and {TRDZ}, followed by {CPZ}. They showed a significant cytotoxic effect against leukemic cells even at 5-10 micro M. The most sensitive cell lines were {MOLT}-4 and Raji, and the most resistant were {HPB}-{ALL} and {CCRF}-{HSB}-2. All phenothiazines induced {PSer} exposure on the surface of leukemic cells, but not of normal lymphocytes. {TFPZ}, {TRDZ} and {CPZ} also induced {DNA} fragmentation in almost all leukemic cell lines during a 48-h incubation. The strongest apoptotic agent was {TRDZ}. The apoptosis induction was not accompanied by a significant release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm of native cells. Moreover, the drugs markedly suppressed Ca(2+)-induced cytochrome c release in isolated mitochondria of leukemic cells.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The results suggest that in clinically relevant doses (up to 20 micro M) some phenothiazines ({TFPZ}, {TRDZ}, {CPZ}) expressed a selective cytotoxicity and antiproliferative activity, and induced apoptosis in leukemic cells without any influence on the viability of normal lymphocytes. It is considered that the mechanism of apoptosis induction in phenothiazine-treated leukemic cells is associated with inhibition of mitochondrial {DNA} polymerase and decreased {ATP} production, which are crucial events for the viability of cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Objective
To determine the relationships between dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia using meta-analysis.

Method
The {PubMed}, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched to identify relevant literature published up to February 2016. The allele contrast model was used. Stata software was used for statistical analysis, with odds ratios ({ORs}) and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}) calculated to evaluate the associations between dopamine D2 receptor gene polymorphisms and the risk of schizophrenia. Meta-regression and publication bias, trim-and-fill, subgroup, sensitivity, cumulative, and fail-safe number analyses were also performed.

Results
This meta-analysis included 81 studies. The rs1801028 and rs1799732 were associated with schizophrenia risk among Asians (P=0.04, {OR} =1.25, 95\% {CI} =1.01–1.55; P{\textless}0.01, {OR} =0.76, 95\% {CI} =0.63–0.92, respectively), while the rs6277 was associated with schizophrenia risk in Caucasians (P{\textless}0.01, {OR}=0.72, 95\% {CI} =0.66–0.79). The rs1800497 was also associated with schizophrenia risk in population-based controls (P{\textless}0.01, {OR} =0.84, 95\% {CI} =0.72–0.97). The rs6275, rs1079597, and rs1800498 were not associated with schizophrenia risk. In addition, meta-regression indicated that the controls may be sources of heterogeneity for the rs1801028 single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}), while ethnicity may be sources of heterogeneity for the rs6277 {SNP}. Publication bias was significant for the rs1801028 {SNP}, and this result changed after the publication bias was adjusted using the trim-and-fill method.

Conclusion
This meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs1801028 may be a risk factor for susceptibility to schizophrenia among Asians, while the rs1799732 may be a protective factor for that population. Large-sample studies are necessary to verify the results of this meta-analysis.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neo.2017.10.002},
	abstract = {{ONC}201/{TIC}10 is a first-in-class small molecule inducer of {TRAIL} that causes early activation of the integrated stress response. Its promising safety profile and broad-spectrum efficacy in vitro have been confirmed in Phase I/{II} trials in several advanced malignancies. Binding and reporter assays have shown that {ONC}201 is a selective antagonist of the dopamine D2-like receptors, specifically, {DRD}2 and {DRD}3. We hypothesized that {ONC}201's interaction with {DRD}2 plays a role in {ONC}201's anticancer effects. Using {cBioportal} and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses, we confirmed that {DRD}2 is expressed in different cancer cell types in a cell type-specific manner. On the other hand, {DRD}3 was generally not detectable. Overexpressing {DRD}2 in cells with low {DRD}2 levels increased {ONC}201-induced {PARP} cleavage, which was preceded and correlated with an increase in {ONC}201-induced {CHOP} {mRNA} expression. On the other hand, knocking out {DRD}2 using {CRISPR}/Cas9 in three cancer cell lines was not sufficient to abrogate {ONC}201's anticancer effects. Although {ONC}201's anticancer activity was not dependent on {DRD}2 expression in the cancer cell types tested, we assessed the cytotoxic potential of {DRD}2 blockade. Transient {DRD}2 knockdown in {HCT}116 cells activated the integrated stress response and reduced cell number. Pharmacological antagonism of {DRD}2 significantly reduced cell viability. Thus, we demonstrate in this study that disrupting dopamine receptor expression and activity can have cytotoxic effects that may at least be in part due to the activation of the integrated stress response. On the other hand, {ONC}201's anticancer activity goes beyond its ability to antagonize {DRD}2, potentially due to {ONC}201's ability to activate other pathways that are independent of {DRD}2. Nevertheless, blocking the dopamine D1-like receptor {DRD}5 via {siRNA} or the use of a pharmacological antagonist promoted {ONC}201-induced anticancer activity.},

	abstract = {Dopamine is a biologically active compound belonging to catecholamines. It plays its roles in the human body, acting both as a circulating hormone and neurotransmitter. It acts through G-protein-coupled receptors divided into two subgroups: D1-like receptors (D1R and D5R) and D2-like receptors (D2R, D3R, D4R). Physiologically, dopamine receptors are involved in central nervous system functions: motivation or cognition, and peripheral actions such as blood pressure and immune response modulation. Increasing evidence indicates that the dopamine D1 receptor may play a significant role in developing different human neoplasms. This receptor’s value was presented in the context of regulating various signaling pathways important in tumor development, including neoplastic cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, migration, invasiveness, or the enrichment of cancer stem cells population. Recent studies proved that its activation by selective or non-selective agonists is associated with significant tumor growth suppression, metastases prevention, and tumor microvasculature maturation. It may also exert a synergistic anti-cancer effect when combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors or temozolomide. This review provides a comprehensive insight into the heterogeneity of dopamine D1 receptor molecular roles and signaling pathways in human neoplasm development and discusses possible perspectives of its therapeutic targeting as an adjunct anti-cancer strategy of treatment. We highlight the priorities for further directions in this research area.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is a progressive neurological disorder caused by rather selective degeneration of the dopaminergic ({DA}) neurons in the substantia nigra. Though subject to intensive research, the etiology of this nigral neuronal loss is still enigmatic and treatment is basically symptomatic. The current major hypothesis suggests that nigral neuronal death in {PD} is due to excessive oxidative stress generated by auto- and enzymatic oxidation of the endogenous neurotransmitter dopamine ({DA}), the formation of neuromelanin and presence of high concentrations of iron. We have found that {DA} toxicity is mediated through its oxidative metabolites. Whereas thiol-containing antioxidants provided marked protection against {DA} toxicity, ascorbic acid accelerated {DA}-induced death. Using the differential display approach, we sought to isolate and characterize genes whose expression is altered in response to {DA} toxicity. We found an upregulation of the collapsin response mediator protein ({CRM}) and {TCP}-1delta in sympathetic neurons, which undergo dopamine-induced apoptosis. The isolation of these genes led us to examine the expression and activity of {CRM} and {TCP}-1delta related genes. Indeed, we found a significant induction of {mRNAs} of the secreted collapsin-1 and the mitochondrial stress protein {HSP}60. Antibodies directed against collapsin-1 provided marked and prolonged protection of several neuronal cell types from dopamine-induced apoptosis. In a parallel study, using antisense technology, we found that inhibition of {TCP}-1delta expression significantly reduced {DA}-induced neuronal death. These findings suggest a functional role for collapsin-1 and {TCP}-1delta as positive mediators of {DA}-induced neuronal apoptosis.},

Research continues to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in {NETosis}. In recent years, interactions with the complement and coagulation systems have become increasingly apparent. Activated complement proteins can stimulate {NET} formation, and {NETs}, in turn, can serve as a platform for complement activation. In addition, {NETs} can act as a scaffold for thrombus formation during coagulation. While crosstalk between the coagulation and complement systems has been previously described, {NETosis} appears to be a third important player in this consortium to protect the host against pathogens. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the mutual interactions between {NETosis}, the complement system and the coagulation system, with an emerging description of their complex triangular relationship.},

	abstract = {Background
The {SARS}-{CoV}-2 pandemic is currently leading to increasing numbers of {COVID}-19 patients all over the world. Clinical presentations range from asymptomatic, mild respiratory tract infection, to severe cases with acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and death. Reports on a dysregulated immune system in the severe cases call for a better characterization and understanding of the changes in the immune system.

Methods
In order to dissect {COVID}-19-driven immune host responses, we performed {RNA}-seq of whole blood cell transcriptomes and granulocyte preparations from mild and severe {COVID}-19 patients and analyzed the data using a combination of conventional and data-driven co-expression analysis. Additionally, publicly available data was used to show the distinction from {COVID}-19 to other diseases. Reverse drug target prediction was used to identify known or novel drug candidates based on finding from data-driven findings.

Results
Here, we profiled whole blood transcriptomes of 39 {COVID}-19 patients and 10 control donors enabling a data-driven stratification based on molecular phenotype. Neutrophil activation-associated signatures were prominently enriched in severe patient groups, which was corroborated in whole blood transcriptomes from an independent second cohort of 30 as well as in granulocyte samples from a third cohort of 16 {COVID}-19 patients (44 samples). Comparison of {COVID}-19 blood transcriptomes with those of a collection of over 3100 samples derived from 12 different viral infections, inflammatory diseases, and independent control samples revealed highly specific transcriptome signatures for {COVID}-19. Further, stratified transcriptomes predicted patient subgroup-specific drug candidates targeting the dysregulated systemic immune response of the host.

Conclusions
Our study provides novel insights in the distinct molecular subgroups or phenotypes that are not simply explained by clinical parameters. We show that whole blood transcriptomes are extremely informative for {COVID}-19 since they capture granulocytes which are major drivers of disease severity.

The discovery that dominant gain-of-function mutations in {NLRP}3 cause the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes ({CAPS}) and trigger spontaneous inflammasome activation and {IL}-1β oversecretion led to successful treatment with {IL}-1-blocking agents. Herein we report a de novo missense mutation (c.1009A {\textgreater} T, encoding p.Thr337Ser) affecting the nucleotide-binding domain of the inflammasome component {NLRC}4 that causes early-onset recurrent fever flares and macrophage activation syndrome ({MAS}). Functional analyses demonstrated spontaneous inflammasome formation and production of the inflammasome-dependent cytokines {IL}-1β and {IL}-18, with the latter exceeding the levels seen in {CAPS}. The {NLRC}4 mutation caused constitutive caspase-1 cleavage in cells transduced with mutant {NLRC}4 and increased production of {IL}-18 in both patient-derived and mutant {NLRC}4-transduced macrophages.

Many patients had chronic neutropenia associated with oral and rectal ulcers. The marked prevalence of infections caused by intracellular pathogens suggests some degree of impairment of cell-mediated immunity. Although lymphocyte counts and in vitro proliferation to mitogens were normal, a defective in vitro proliferative response to antigens was observed in some patients, and additional defects of cell-mediated immunity may be presumed on the basis of current knowledge of {CD}40-ligand function. All patients received regular infusions of immunoglobulins. Four patients underwent liver transplantation because of sclerosing cholangitis, which relapsed in there. Three patients underwent bone marrow transplantation. Thirteen patients (23\%) died of infection and/or liver disease.

Genetic variation in Toll-like receptors ({TLRs}), key innate immune receptors or their signalling molecules, have been described.

This genetic variation can result in an altered immune response to pathogenic challenge as well as exorbitant immune activation and inflammation, and thus may influence the pathogenesis or outcome of disease. Examples include variants of {TLR}4 in sepsis, malaria, inflammatory bowel disease and atherosclerosis; variants in {TLR}2 in tuberculosis and asthma; a variant in Mal (a key signal for {TLR}2 and {TLR}4) in malaria, tuberculosis and systemic lupus erythematosus; and variants in the kinase {IRAK}4 in pyogenic infections.

In this study, we report that I602S, a common single nucleotide polymorphism within {TLR}1, is associated with aberrant trafficking of the receptor to the cell surface and diminished responses of blood monocytes to bacterial agonists. When expressed in heterologous systems, the {TLR}1 602S variant, but not the {TLR}1 602I variant, exhibits the expected deficiencies in trafficking and responsiveness. Among white Europeans, the 602S allele represents the most common single nucleotide polymorphism affecting {TLR} function identified to date.

Mitogen proliferation may be normal, but {NK}- and T-cell cytotoxicity can be impaired. Antigen-specific responses are usually decreased or absent. Total numbers of B cells are normal but there is a marked reduction of class-switched memory B cells. Defective oxidative burst of both neutrophils and macrophages has been reported. The range of clinical findings varies, even within the same family. More than 50\% of males with {HIGM}1 develop symptoms by age one year, and more than 90\% are symptomatic by age four years. {HIGM}1 usually presents in infancy with recurrent upper- and lower-respiratory tract bacterial infections, opportunistic infections including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and recurrent or protracted diarrhea that can be infectious or noninfectious and is associated with failure to thrive. Neutropenia is common; thrombocytopenia and anemia are less commonly seen. Autoimmune and/or inflammatory disorders (such as sclerosing cholangitis) as well as increased risk for neoplasms have been reported as medical complications of this disorder. Significant neurologic complications, often the result of a {CNS} infection, are seen in 5\%-15\% of affected males. Liver disease, a serious complication of {HIGM}1 once observed in more than 80\% of affected males by age 20 years, may be decreasing with adequate screening and treatment of Cryptosporidium infection., The diagnosis of X-linked hyper {IgM} syndrome is established in a male proband with typical clinical and laboratory findings and a hemizygous pathogenic variant in {CD}40LG identified by molecular genetic testing., Treatment of manifestations: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ({HSCT}) (the only curative treatment currently available), ideally performed before age ten years, prior to evidence of organ damage; immunoglobulin replacement therapy (either intravenous or subcutaneous); appropriate antimicrobial therapy for acute infections; antimicrobial prophylaxis for opportunistic infection against Pneumocysitis jirovecii pneumonia; recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for chronic neutropenia; immunosuppressants for autoimmune disorders. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Areas that place individual at risk of contracting Cryptosporidium including pools, lakes, ponds, or certain water sources; drinking unpurified or unfiltered water; live vaccines such as rotavirus, {MMR}, varicella, live attenuated polio, and {BCG}. Surveillance: At least annually: {CBC} with differential to monitor for cytopenias, testing of {IgG} levels and lymphocyte subpopulations, pulmonary function tests after age seven years. Regular assessment of liver function, consider abdominal imaging; as well as polymerase chain reaction-based testing for the presence of enteric pathogens including Cryptosporidium. Monitor growth and general health with a low threshold for lymph node biopsy, given elevated oncologic risk. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of newborn at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment and prevention of infections., By definition, X-linked hyper {IgM} syndrome ({HIGM}1) is inherited in an X-linked manner. Affected males transmit the pathogenic variant to all their daughters and none of their sons. Women with a {CD}40LG pathogenic variant have a 50\% chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Female who inherit the pathogenic variant will typically be asymptomatic but may have a range of clinical manifestation depending on X-chromosome inactivation. Once the {CD}40LG pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk female relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing for {HIGM}1 are possible.},

It is an inherited condition caused by a variety of mutations in the autoimmune regulator ({AIRE}) gene that encodes a protein whose function has been uncovered by the generation and study of Aire-{KO} mice. These provided invaluable insights into the link between {AIRE} expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells ({mTECs}), and the broad spectrum of self-antigens that these cells express and present to the developing thymocytes. However, these murine models poorly recapitulate all phenotypic aspects of human {APECED}. Unlike Aire-{KO} mice, the recently generated Aire-{KO} rat model presents visual features, organ lymphocytic infiltrations and production of autoantibodies that resemble those observed in {APECED} patients, making the rat model a main research asset. In addition, ex vivo models of {AIRE}-dependent self-antigen expression in primary {mTECs} have been successfully set up. Thymus organoids based on pluripotent stem cell-derived {TECs} from {APECED} patients are also emerging, and constitute a promising tool to engineer {AIRE}-corrected {mTECs} and restore the generation of regulatory T cells. Eventually, these new models will undoubtedly lead to main advances in the identification and assessment of specific and efficient new therapeutic strategies aiming to restore immunological tolerance in {APECED} patients., Summary: In this Review, we discuss the in vivo and in vitro models available to study {AIRE} deficiency, and how they may contribute to restoring immunological tolerance in {APECED} patients.},

The most common cause of {HVS} is Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia ({WM}), and therefore, the term {HVS} is typically used to describe an increase in serum proteins.

	abstract = {The existence of enteric dopaminergic neurons has been suspected; however, the innervation of the gut by sympathetic nerves, in which dopamine ({DA}) is the norepinephrine precursor, complicates analyses of enteric {DA}. We now report that transcripts encoding tyrosine hydroxylase ({TH}) and the {DA} transporter ({DAT}) are present in the murine bowel (small intestine {\textgreater} stomach or colon; proximal colon {\textgreater} distal colon). Because sympathetic neurons are extrinsic, transcripts encoding {TH} and {DAT} in the bowel are probably derived from intrinsic neurons. {TH} protein was demonstrated immunocytochemically in neuronal perikarya (submucosal {\textgreater}{\textgreater} myenteric plexus; small intestine {\textgreater} stomach or colon). {TH}, {DA}, and {DAT} immunoreactivities were coincident in subsets of neurons (submucosal {\textgreater} myenteric) in guinea pig and mouse intestines in situ and in cultured guinea pig enteric ganglia. Surgical ablation of sympathetic nerves by extrinsic denervation of loops of the bowel did not affect {DAT} immunoreactivity but actually increased numbers of {TH}-immunoreactive neurons, expression of {mRNA} encoding {TH} and {DAT}, and enteric {DOPAC} (the specific dopamine metabolite). The fetal gut contains transiently catecholaminergic ({TC}) cells. {TC} cells are the proliferating crest-derived precursors of mature neurons that are not catecholaminergic and, thus, disappear after embryonic day (E) 14 (mouse) or E15 (rat). {TC} cells appear early in ontogeny, and their development/survival is dependent on mash-1 gene expression. In contrast, the intrinsic {TH}-expressing neurons of the murine bowel appear late (perinatally) and are mash-1 independent. We conclude that the enteric nervous system contains intrinsic dopaminergic neurons that arise from a mash-1-independent lineage of noncatecholaminergic precursors.},

Alterations of dopaminergic signaling are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, in particular Parkinson’s disease, which are associated with a subtle and chronic inflammatory response. A substantial body of evidence has demonstrated the non-neuronal expression of dopamine, its receptors and of the machinery that governs synthesis, secretion and storage of dopamine across several immune cell types. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the role and expression of dopamine in immune cells. One of the goals is to decipher the complex mechanisms through which these cell types respond to dopamine, in order to address the impact this has on neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies such as Parkinson’s disease. A further aim is to illustrate the gaps in our understanding of the physiological roles of dopamine to encourage more targeted research focused on understanding the consequences of aberrant dopamine production on immune regulation. These highlights may prompt scientists in the field to consider alternative functions of this important neurotransmitter when targeting neuroinflammatory/neurodegenerative pathologies.},

The association with chronic lower respiratory disease mortality was stronger in individuals with prevalent lung diseases ({HR} 1.46, 95\% {CI} 1.14–1.88, Pinteraction = 0.01), while {NLR} showed positive associations with mortality from heart disease (1.21, 1.07–1.38) and cerebrovascular disease (1.30, 1.04–1.63) only among individuals without these conditions at baseline. {NLR} is associated with mortality overall and due to certain causes in the general population. Associations over short follow-up intervals and among individuals with conditions at baseline suggest effects of disordered inflammation and immunity on progression of those conditions, while other associations may reflect contributions to disease etiology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that is more effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in the treatment of patients with refractory schizophrenia. Unlike classic neuroleptic agents, clozapine is not associated with the development of acute extrapyramidal symptoms or tardive dyskinesia. The main factor limiting its use is the risk of potentially fatal agranulocytosis, estimated to occur in 1 to 2 percent of treated patients. After clozapine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, it became available for marketing in the United States in February 1990 only as part of a special surveillance system (the Clozaril Patient Management System, or {CPMS}), in which a weekly white-cell count was required for the patient to receive a supply of the drug.
{METHODS}: We evaluated the {CPMS} data for February 1990 through April 1991 by survival analysis to determine the incidence of agranulocytosis and the effects of potential risk factors such as age and sex. Data were available for 11,555 patients who received clozapine during the period after marketing began.
{RESULTS}: Agranulocytosis developed in 73 patients, resulting in death from infectious complications in 2 patients. Episodes of agranulocytosis occurred in 61 patients within three months after they began treatment. The cumulative incidence of this side effect was 0.80 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99) at 1 year and 0.91 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62 to 1.20) at 1 1/2 years. The risk of agranulocytosis increased with age and was higher among women.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The occurrence of agranulocytosis is a substantial hazard of the administration of clozapine, but this hazard can be reduced by monitoring the white-cell count. The increasing risk of agranulocytosis with age and the reduced incidence after the first six months of treatment provide additional guidelines for the prescription and monitoring of clozapine treatment in the future.},

	abstract = {Background: For the normal resolution of an acute inflammatory response, neutrophil ({PMN}) apoptosis is essential to maintain immune homeostasis and to limit inappropriate host tissue damage. A delay in {PMN} apoptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ({SIRS}). Dopamine, a biogenic amine with known cardiovascular and neurotransmitter properties, is used in patients with {SIRS} to maintain hemodynamic stability. We sought to determine whether dopamine may also have immunoregulatory properties capable of influencing {PMN} apoptosis, function, and activation state in patients with {SIRS}. Methods: {PMNs} were isolated from healthy volunteers and patients with {SIRS} and treated with varying doses of dopamine and a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist, fenoldopam. {PMN} apoptosis was assessed every 6 hours with use of propidium iodide {DNA} staining and {PMN} function was assessed with use of respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis ability, and {CD}11a, {CD}11b, and {CD}18 receptor expression as functional markers. Results: There was a significant delay in {PMN} apotosis in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment of isolated {PMNs} from both healthy controls and patients with {SIRS} with 10 and 100 μmol/L dopamine induced apoptosis. {PMN} ingestive and cytocidal capacity were both decreased in patients with {SIRS} compared with controls. Treatment with dopamine significantly increased phagocytic function. Fenoldopam did not induce {PMN} apoptosis. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate for the first time that dopamine induces {PMN} apoptosis and modulates {PMN} function both in healthy controls and in patients with {SIRS}. These results indicate that dopamine may be beneficial during {SIRS} through a nonhemodynamic {PMN}-dependent proapoptotic mechanism. (Surgery 1999;126:314-22.)},

	abstract = {X-linked agammaglobulinemia or {XLA} is one of the most common pediatric primary immunodeficiencies that prevent affected individuals from making antibodies and requires lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy for survival. The molecular basis for {XLA} is a disruption in B cell development due to mutation in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). Affected individuals inherit a defect that prevents precursor B cells in the bone marrow from forming mature, circulating B-lymphocytes that would otherwise be capable of proliferating and differentiating into antibody-producing plasma cells in secondary lymphoid organs like the tonsils and lymph nodes. This dysfunction results in dangerously low, clinically undetectable levels of all immunoglobulin isotypes in the serum. Without immunoglobulins (or antibodies), {XLA} patients are rendered vulnerable to invasive infections from encapsulated bacteria (such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenzae), have an increased incidence of enterovirus infections (e.g., poliovirus, coxsackievirus, echovirus), and chronic diarrhea (from Giardia lamblia). {XLA} patients commonly present with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, including sinusitis and otitis media, beginning after 6 to 9 months when most of the maternal antibodies have been exhausted.  However, hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia, requiring intravenous antibiotics for resolution, is usually what prompts the diagnostic work-up for immune deficiency disease. The average age of diagnosis is 2.5 years, and almost all cases of {XLA} get diagnosed before 5 years of age. Notably, late-onset forms of {XLA} also exist. There is currently no cure for {XLA}; however, early management with immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antibiotics to prevent and treat infections. Although this lifelong avenue is costly, it has been the mainstay of treatment for the past fifty years. Any significant delay in diagnosis poses the danger of developing chronic, treatment-resistant infections, and end-organ damage that cannot be corrected.},

Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors are the most abundant dopaminergic receptors in the striatum, and although a clear segregation between the pathways expressing these two receptors has been reported in certain subregions, the presence of D1-D2 receptor heteromers within a unique subset of neurons, forming a novel signaling transducing functional entity has been shown.

Objectives To determine whether a different peripheral immune profile and {NLR} were present in {PD} patients. Methods We conducted a case–control study that included 377 {PD} patients and 355 healthy controls ({HCs}). Leukocytes, subpopulations, and the {NLR} were measured. Multivariate linear regression analyses were applied to determine the differences between groups and the association between {NLR} and clinical characteristics in {PD}. A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the association between {NLR} and {PD}. Results In our case–control study, the {NLR} was significantly higher in {PD} patients compared with {HCs} (2.47 ± 1.1 vs. 1.98 ± 0.91, P {\textless} 0.001). No association between {NLR} and age at onset, disease severity, or disease duration was found. The meta-analysis showed that the {NLR} was likely to be higher in {PD} patients.

Signs of microglia activation in the {PD} brain postmortem as well as during disease development revealed by neuroimaging, implicate immune responses in the pathophysiology of the disease. Intensive research during the last two decades has advanced our understanding of the role of these responses in the disease process, yet many questions remain unanswered. A transformative finding in the field has been the confirmation that in vivo microglia are able to respond directly to pathological a-syn aggregates but also to neuronal dysfunction due to intraneuronal a-syn toxicity well in advance of neuronal death. In addition, clinical research and disease models have revealed the involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Indeed, the data suggest that {PD} leads not only to a microglia response, but also to a cellular and humoral peripheral immune response. Together, these findings compel us to consider a more holistic view of the immunological processes associated with the disease. Central and peripheral immune responses aimed at maintaining neuronal health will ultimately have consequences on neuronal survival. We will review here the most significant findings that have contributed to the current understanding of the immune response in {PD}, which is proposed to occur early, involve peripheral and brain immune cells, evolve as neuronal dysfunction progresses, and is likely to influence disease progression.,

We present subsequent findings linking these deficits to a model of dopaminergic function that conforms to an inverted curvilinear function. We review studies that investigated the range of dopamine-independent attentional and visuospatial memory deficits seen in {PD}, demonstrating that abnormalities in these domains more accurately predict {PDD}. We conclude with an exposition of the dual syndrome hypothesis, which distinguishes between dopaminergically mediated fronto-striatal executive impairments and a dementia syndrome with distinctive prodromal visuospatial deficits in which cholinergic treatments offer some clinical benefits.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the death of neurons, ie, cells critical to the production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter in the brain. Here, we present a brief review of the dopamine synthetic pathway, binding to the dopamine receptors, and subsequent action. The production of dopamine (a monoamine neurotransmitter) occurs in the ventral tegmental area ({VTA}) of the substantia nigra, specifically in the hypothalamic nucleus and midbrain. Compared to other monoamines, dopamine is widely distributed in the olfactory bulb, midbrain substantia nigra, hypothalamus, {VTA}, retina, and the periaqueductal gray area. Dopamine receptors are large G-protein coupled receptor family members, of which there are five subtypes including D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. These subtypes are further divided into two subclasses: D1-like family receptors (types 1 and 5) and D2-like family receptors (types 2, 3, and 4). Four different pathways and functions of the dopaminergic system are presented in this review. In the oxidation of dopamine, 5,6-indolequinone, dopamine-o-quinone, and aminochrome are formed. It is difficult to separate the roles of 5,6-indolequinone and dopamine-o-quinone in the degenerative process of Parkinson’s diseases due to their instability. The role of aminochrome in Parkinson’s disease is to form and stabilize the neurotoxic protofibrils of alpha-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and the degradation of protein by lysosomal systems and proteasomes. The neurotoxic effects of aminochrome can be inhibited by preventing the polymerization of 5,6-indolequinone, dopamine-o-quinone, and aminochrome into neuromelanin, by reducing aminochrome catalysis by {DT}-diaphorase, and by preventing dopamine oxidative deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase. In addition to these, the conversion of dopamine in the neuromelanin ({NM}) shows both protective and toxic roles. Therefore, the aims of this review were to discuss and explain the role of dopamine and explore its physiology and specificity in Parkinson's disease, as well as its role in other physiological functions.},

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease ({PD}) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused mainly by lack of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory, and other functions; its level is decreased in {PD} brain as a result of dopaminergic cell death. Dopamine loss in {PD} brain is a cause of motor deficiency and, possibly, a reason of the cognitive deficit observed in some {PD} patients. {PD} is mostly not recognized in its early stage because of a long latency between the first damage to dopaminergic cells and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is very important to find reliable molecular biomarkers that can distinguish {PD} from other conditions, monitor its progression, or give an indication of a positive response to a therapeutic intervention. {PD} biomarkers can be subdivided into four main types: clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic. For a long time protein biomarkers, dopamine metabolites, amino acids, etc. in blood, serum, cerebrospinal liquid ({CSF}) were considered the most promising. Among the candidate biomarkers that have been tested, various forms of α-synuclein (α-syn), i.e., soluble, aggregated, post-translationally modified, etc. were considered potentially the most efficient. However, the encouraging recent results suggest that {microRNA}-based analysis may bring considerable progress, especially if it is combined with α-syn data. Another promising analysis is the advanced metabolite profiling of body fluids, called “metabolomics” which may uncover metabolic fingerprints specific for various stages of {PD}. Conventional pharmacological treatment of {PD} is based on the replacement of dopamine using dopamine precursors (levodopa, L-{DOPA}, L-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine), dopamine agonists (amantadine, apomorphine) and {MAO}-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), which can be used alone or in combination with each other. Potential risk factors include environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular damage, and genomic defects. This review covers molecules that might act as the biomarkers of {PD}. Then, {PD} risk factors (including genetics and non-genetic factors) and {PD} treatment options are discussed.},

D1-like receptor signaling is mediated chiefly by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαs and Gαolf, which cause sequential activation of adenylate cyclase, cylic {AMP}-dependent protein kinase, and the protein phosphatase-1 inhibitor {DARPP}-32. The increased phosphorylation that results from the combined effects of activating cyclic {AMP}-dependent protein kinase and inhibiting protein phosphatase 1 regulates the activity of many receptors, enzymes, ion channels, and transcription factors. D1 or a novel D1-like receptor also signals via phospholipase C-dependent and cyclic {AMP}-independent mobilization of intracellular calcium. D2-like receptor signaling is mediated by the heterotrimeric G proteins Gαi and Gαo. These pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins regulate some effectors, such as adenylate cyclase, via their Gα subunits, but regulate many more effectors such as ion channels, phospholipases, protein kinases, and receptor tyrosine kinases as a result of the receptor-induced liberation of Gβγ subunits. In addition to interactions between dopamine receptors and G proteins, other protein:protein interactions such as receptor oligomerization or receptor interactions with scaffolding and signal-switching proteins are critical for regulation of dopamine receptor signaling.},

Circulating neutrophils are rapidly recruited to sites of infection by host- and/or pathogen-derived components, which also prime these host cells for enhanced microbicidal activity. {PMNs} bind and ingest microorganisms by a process known as phagocytosis, which typically triggers production of reactive oxygen species and the fusion of cytoplasmic granules with pathogen-containing vacuoles. The combination of neutrophil reactive oxygen species and granule components is highly effective in killing most bacteria and fungi. Inasmuch as {PMNs} are the most abundant type of leukocyte in humans and contain an arsenal of cytotoxic compounds that are non-specific, neutrophil homeostasis must be highly regulated. To that end, constitutive {PMN} turnover is regulated by apoptosis, a process whereby these cells shut down and are removed safely by macrophages. Notably, apoptosis is accelerated following phagocytosis of bacteria, a process that appears important for the resolution of infection and inflammation.

	abstract = {Mature blood neutrophils have a short lifespan in vitro and are not easily transfectable. We obtained terminally mature neutrophils after differentiation of immature transfectable {PLB}-985 myeloid cells by treatment with dimethylformamide (0.5\%), Nutridoma {SP} (1\%) and fetal calf serum (0.5\%). Maturation was shown by functional degranulation, in response to bacterial N-formyl peptide ({fMLP}), of specific granules and secretory vesicle contents; the latter emerge during the last step of normal neutrophil differentiation into bone marrow. These differentiated cells also produced quantities of superoxide anion similar to those produced by blood neutrophils, in response to physiological stimuli ({fMLP}); in addition, the {fMLP}-induced respiratory burst was primed by the proinflammatory cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Thus, in our experimental conditions, {PLB}-985 cells transformed into fully differentiated neutrophils capable of fine regulation by inflammatory agents. This cell model will help in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neutrophil functions.},

	abstract = {Studies of cellular apoptosis have been significantly impacted since the introduction of flow cytometry-based methods. Propidium iodide ({PI}) is widely used in conjunction with Annexin V to determine if cells are viable, apoptotic, or necrotic through differences in plasma membrane integrity and permeability1,2. The Annexin V/ {PI} protocol is a commonly used approach for studying apoptotic cells3. {PI} is used more often than other nuclear stains because it is economical, stable and a good indicator of cell viability, based on its capacity to exclude dye in living cells 4,5. The ability of {PI} to enter a cell is dependent upon the permeability of the membrane; {PI} does not stain live or early apoptotic cells due to the presence of an intact plasma membrane 1,2,6. In late apoptotic and necrotic cells, the integrity of the plasma and nuclear membranes decreases7,8, allowing {PI} to pass through the membranes, intercalate into nucleic acids, and display red fluorescence 1,2,9. Unfortunately, we find that conventional Annexin V/ {PI} protocols lead to a significant number of false positive events (up to 40\%), which are associated with {PI} staining of {RNA} within the cytoplasmic compartment10. Primary cells and cell lines in a broad range of animal models are affected, with large cells (nuclear: cytoplasmic ratios {\textless}0.5) showing the highest occurrence10. Herein, we demonstrate a modified Annexin V/ {PI} method that provides a significant improvement for assessment of cell death compared to conventional methods. This protocol takes advantage of changes in cellular permeability during cell fixing to promote entry of {RNase} A into cells following staining. Both the timing and concentration of {RNase} A have been optimized for removal of cytoplasmic {RNA}. The result is a significant improvement over conventional Annexin V/ {PI} protocols ({\textless} 5\% events with cytoplasmic {PI} staining).},

	abstract = {Background: On the current psychopharmacological panorama, the variety of substances able to provoke an episode of acute psychosis is rapidly increasing. Such psychotic episodes are classified according to the major category of symptoms: positive, negative, or cognitive psychotic episodes. On one hand, the abuse of methamphetamines, cannabis, and cocaine plays a big role in increasing the incidence of episodes resembling a psychotic disorder. On the other hand, the progress in terms of pharmacodynamics knowledge has led to the synthesis of new drugs, such as cannabinoids and cathinone's, which have rapidly entered into the common pool of abusers' habits. Regarding these newly synthesized substances of abuse, further clinical studies are needed to understand their psychogenic properties. The topic of this review is complicated due to the frequent abuse of psychotomimetic drugs by patients affected by psychotic disorders, a fact that makes it extremely difficult to distinguish between an induced psychosis and a re-exacerbation of a previously diagnosed disorder., Methods: The present narrative review summarizes results from clinical studies, thus investigating the psychotogenic properties of abused substances and the psychotic symptoms they can give rise to. It also discusses the association between substance abuse and psychosis, especially with regards to the differential diagnosis between a primary vs. a substance-induced psychotic disorder., Findings: Our findings support the theory that psychosis due to substance abuse is commonly observed in clinical practice. The propensity to develop psychosis seems to be a function of the severity of use and addiction. Of note, from a phenomenological point of view, it is possible to identify some elements that may help clinicians involved in differential diagnoses between primary and substance-induced psychoses. There remains a striking paucity of information on the outcomes, treatments, and best practices of substance-induced psychotic episodes.},

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}), a biomarker of systemic inflammation, has been reported to be higher in patients with {PD} than in healthy controls ({HCs}). The present study was aimed at determining if the peripheral inflammatory immune response could be influenced by the genetic background of patients with {PD}. We included a discovery cohort with 222 patients with {PD} (132 sporadic {PD}, 44 {LRRK}2-associated {PD} (with p.G2019S and p.R1441G variants), and 46 {GBA}-associated {PD}), as well as 299 {HCs}. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Leukocytes and their subpopulations, and the {NLR} were measured in peripheral blood. Multivariate lineal regression and post-hoc tests were applied to determine the differences among the groups. Subsequently, a replication study using the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative cohort was performed which included 401 patients with {PD} (281 {sPD} patients, 66 {LRRK}2-{PD} patients, 54 {GBA}-{PD} patients) and a group of 174 {HCs}. Patients with sporadic {PD} and {GBA}-associated {PD} showed a significantly lower lymphocyte count, a non-significantly higher neutrophil count and a significantly higher {NLR} than {HCs}. The peripheral inflammatory immune response of patients with {LRRK}2-associated {PD} did not differ from {HCs}. Our study supports the involvement of a peripheral inflammatory immune response in the pathophysiology of {sPD} and {GBA}-associated {PD}. However, this inflammatory response was not found in {LRRK}2-associated {PD}, probably reflecting different pathogenic inflammatory mechanisms.},

Results showed that the drug had a biphasic effect: the lowest dose decreased and the high doses increased the amount of locomotion and of movement. The decrease in activity produced by the low dose had its onset within minutes after administration of the drug; persistent and marked hyperactivity was observed from about 60–80 min after injection of 0.5–8 mg/kg of quinpirole. Moreover, in animals injected with intermediate doses, the excitation was preceded by a brief period of reduced locomotion.

Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of {NETosis}, the precise mechanism underlying {NETosis} is still a matter of debate. Research continues to elucidate the molecular pathways involved in {NETosis}. In recent years, interactions with the complement and coagulation systems have become increasingly apparent. Activated complement proteins can stimulate {NET} formation, and {NETs}, in turn, can serve as a platform for complement activation. In addition, {NETs} can act as a scaffold for thrombus formation during coagulation. While crosstalk between the coagulation and complement systems has been previously described, {NETosis} appears to be a third important player in this consortium to protect the host against pathogens. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the mutual interactions between {NETosis}, the complement system and the coagulation system, with an emerging description of their complex triangular relationship.},

	abstract = {Bloodstream infections ({BSI}) are among the most frequent complications in neutropenic cancer patients and, if caused by Gram-negative rods, are associated with high mortality. Thus, fever during neutropenia warrants prompt empirical antibiotic therapy which should be active against the most frequent Gram-negatives. In the last decade, there has been a worldwide increase in multidrug resistant ({MDR}) strains. In these cases, the traditional choices such as oral therapy, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, or even carbapenems, might be ineffective. Therefore novel de-escalation approach has been proposed for patients who are at high risk for infections due to {MDR} bacteria. It consists of starting antibiotics which cover the most probable resistant strain but it is narrowed down after 72 hours if no {MDR} pathogen is isolated. With increasing bacterial resistance, the benefit of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis during prolonged neutropenia remains to be confirmed. Antibiotic stewardship and infection control programs are mandatory in every cancer center.},

	abstract = {Dopamine is well recognized as a neurotransmitter in the brain, and
regulates critical functions in a variety of peripheral systems. Growing
research has also shown that dopamine acts as an important regulator of immune
function. Many immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopamine
related proteins, enabling them to actively respond to dopamine and suggesting
that dopaminergic immunoregulation is an important part of proper immune
function. A detailed understanding of the physiological concentrations of
dopamine in specific regions of the human body, particularly in peripheral
systems, is critical to the development of hypotheses and experiments examining
the effects of physiologically relevant dopamine concentrations on immune cells.
Unfortunately, the dopamine concentrations to which these immune cells would be
exposed in different anatomical regions are not clear. To address this issue,
this comprehensive review details the current information regarding
concentrations of dopamine found in both the central nervous system and in many
regions of the periphery. In addition, we discuss the immune cells present in
each region, and how these could interact with dopamine in each compartment
described. Finally, the review briefly addresses how changes in these dopamine
concentrations could influence immune cell dysfunction in several disease states
including Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease, as well as the collection of pathologies, cognitive
and motor symptoms associated with {HIV} infection in the central nervous system,
known as {NeuroHIV}. These data will improve our understanding of the interactions
between the dopaminergic and immune systems during both homeostatic function and
in disease, clarify the effects of existing dopaminergic drugs and promote the
creation of new therapeutic strategies based on manipulating immune function
through dopaminergic signaling.,},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ({HSPCs}) are regulated by signals from the marrow niche. Liu et al delineate a novel signalling pathway for {HSPCs} by which sympathetic nerve-derived dopamine regulates {HSPCs} by upregulating the kinase Lck, which in turn regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase modulation of stem cell factor signaling. This critical role for dopamine potentially could be exploited therapeutically to improve {HSPC} expansion following stem cell transplantation or recovery from marrow-suppressive insults., 
Dopamine signaling influences hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, {HSPC} proliferation, and transplantation efficiency.Dopamine maintains Lck expression to control stem cell factor–induced {ERK} signaling downstream of c-Kit.
, 
, Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell ({HSPC}) function in bone marrow ({BM}) is controlled by stroma-derived signals, but the identity and interplay of these signals remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that sympathetic nerve–derived dopamine directly controls {HSPC} behavior through D2 subfamily dopamine receptors. Blockade of dopamine synthesis, as well as pharmacological or genetic inactivation of D2 subfamily dopamine receptors, leads to reduced {HSPC} frequency, inhibition of proliferation, and low {BM} transplantation efficiency. Conversely, treatment with a D2-type receptor agonist increases {BM} regeneration and transplantation efficiency. Mechanistically, dopamine controls expression of the lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck), which, in turn, regulates {MAPK}-mediated signaling triggered by stem cell factor in {HSPCs}. Our work reveals critical functional roles of dopamine in {HSPCs}, which may open up new therapeutic options for improved {BM} transplantation and other conditions requiring the rapid expansion of {HSPCs}.},

Cell fate decisions at the levels of proliferation and differentiation are enforced through expression of lineage-determining transcription factors and their interactions, which are influenced by intrinsic (intracellular) and extrinsic (extracellular) mechanisms. Neutrophil homeostasis is subjected to positive-feedback loops, stemming from the gut microbiome, as well as negative-feedback loops resulting from the clearance of apoptotic neutrophils by mature macrophages.

The demographic data and duration of the disease, the drugs, duration of usage of Parkinson drugs, Hoehn-Yahr stage were noted. After full neurological examination blood samples are collected and neutrophil, lymphocyte counts, high sensitive {CRP}, {ESR} levels are detected. Results: The N/L ratio and the {CRP} levels were statistically higher in Parkinson’s group. There was a statistically significant but weak positive correlation between the {CRP} levels and the N/L ratio with the disease duration. Similarly, there was a statistically significant but weak positive correlation between the {CRP} levels and the N/L ratios with Hoehn-Yahr stages. When the N/L rates of the Parkinson's patients were correlated with the {CRP} and the {ESR} levels separately, it was observed that there was a weak but statistically significant correlation between the {CRP} and the N/L ratio Conclusion: N/L ratio, and {CRP} levels, which are very important indicators of peripheral inflammation, was higher in {PD}.

This type of cell death (apoptosis), which physiologically occurs in the intrathymic process of immune cell selection, is usually evaluated by either electrophoretic or colorimetric methods which measure {DNA} fragmentation in the nuclear extracts. These techniques are unable to determine the percentage of apoptotic nuclei or recognize the apoptotic cells in a heterogeneous cell population. We have developed a flow cytometric method for measuring the percentage of apoptotic nuclei after propidium iodide staining in hypotonic buffer and have compared it with the classical colorimetric and electrophoretic techniques using dexamethasone ({DEX})-treated mouse thymocytes. Apoptotic nuclei appeared as a broad hypodiploid {DNA} peak which was easily discriminable from the narrow peak of thymocytes with normal (diploid) {DNA} content in the red fluorescence channels. When the {DEX}-induced apoptosis was inhibited by either low-temperature (4 degrees C) incubation or cycloheximide treatment, no hypodiploid {DNA} peak appeared. Similarly, thymocyte death induced by sodium azide, a substance with cell-killing activity through non-apoptotic mechanisms, did not result in any variation in the normal {DNA} peak. The flow cytometric data showed an excellent correlation with the results obtained with both electrophoretic and colorimetric methods. This new rapid, simple and reproducible method should prove useful for assessing apoptosis of specific cell populations in heterogeneous tissues such as bone marrow, thymus and lymph nodes.},

	abstract = {Dopamine ({DA}) is a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system as well as in peripheral tissues. Emerging evidence however points to {DA} also as a key transmitter between the nervous system and the immune system as well as a mediator produced and released by immune cells themselves. Dopaminergic pathways have received so far extensive attention in the adaptive branch of the immune system, where they play a role in health and disease such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and Parkinson's disease. Comparatively little is known about {DA} and the innate immune response, although {DA} may affect innate immune system cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. The present review aims at providing a complete and exhaustive summary of currently available evidence about {DA} and innate immunity, and to become a reference for anyone potentially interested in the fields of immunology, neurosciences and pharmacology. A wide array of dopaminergic drugs is used in therapeutics for non-immune indications, such as Parkinson's disease, hyperprolactinemia, shock, hypertension, with a usually favorable therapeutic index, and they might be relatively easily repurposed for immune-mediated disease, thus leading to innovative treatments at low price, with benefit for patients as well as for the healthcare systems.},

In contrast, H2O2 release was only significantly increased by 56\% in chronically treated patients. In agreement, the maximum rate of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence, which partly represents O2- H2O2- .{NO} interactions, was increased only in the treated group. When other blood markers of oxidative stress were compared, only erythrocyte catalase activity was decreased in both {PD} patient series by 33 and 39\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), whereas plasma antioxidant capacity and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity levels were decreased only in treated {PD} patients. This study suggests that neutrophils express a primary alteration of .{NO} release in {PD} patients, whereas H2O2 and oxidative-stress parameters are more probably related to the evolution of {PD} or to effects of treatment with L-dopa.},

Only about 10\% of cases have a genetic cause, and these cases are seen in young people. The disorder has a slow onset but is progressive. Tremor is often the first symptom and later can be associated with bradykinesia and rigidity. Postural instability is usually seen late in the disease and can seriously impact the quality of life. Also of importance is the presence of autonomic symptoms that may precede the motor symptoms in some patients.

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease ({PD}), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by distinct aging-independent loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta ({SNpc}) region urging toward neuronal loss. Over the decade, various key findings from clinical perspective to molecular pathogenesis have aided in understanding the genetics with assorted genes related with {PD}. Subsequently, several pathways have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of {PD}, involving mitochondrial dysfunction, protein aggregation, and misfolding. On the other hand, the sporadic form of {PD} cases is found with no genetic linkage, which still remain an unanswered question? The exertion in ascertaining vulnerability factors in {PD} considering the genetic factors are to be further dissevered in the forthcoming decades with advancement in research studies. One of the major proponents behind the prognosis of {PD} is the pathogenic transmutation of aberrant alpha-synuclein protein into amyloid fibrillar structures, which actuates neurodegeneration. Alpha-synuclein, transcribed by {SNCA} gene is a neuroprotein found predominantly in brain. It is implicated in the modulation of synaptic vesicle transport and eventual release of neurotransmitters. Due to genetic mutations and other elusive factors, the alpha-synuclein misfolds into its amyloid form. Therefore, this review aims in briefing the molecular understanding of the alpha-synuclein associated with {PD}.},

Dardarin is a large protein, and mutations are found throughout the gene including the kinase domain. However, it is not clear if kinase activity is important for the damaging effects of pathogenic mutations. In this study, we noted two cellular phenotypes associated with mutant dardarin. First, pathogenic mutations increase the tendency of dardarin to form inclusion bodies. Secondly, neurons and neuronal cell lines undergo cell death after expression of mutant protein. Manipulating activity by replacing the kinase domain with a ‘kinase-dead’ version blocks inclusion body formation and strongly delays cell death. This predicts that kinase inhibitors will be useful therapeutic agents in patients with {LRRK}2 mutations and, perhaps, in sporadic {PD}. We also show that dardarin protein is expressed within human midbrain neurons and that C-terminal epitopes are also found in some Lewy bodies.},

Cleavage of {XTT} by dehydrogenase enzymes of metabolically active cells yields a highly colored formazan product which is water soluble. This feature obviates the need for formazan crystal solubilization prior to absorbance measurements, as required when using other tetrazolium salts such as {MTT}. Bioreduction of {XTT} by all the murine cells examined was not particularly efficient, but could be potentiated by addition of electron coupling agents such as phenazine methosulfate ({PMS}) or menadione ({MEN}). Optimal concentrations of {PMS} or {MEN} were determined for the metabolism of {XTT} by the T cell lines {HT}-2 and 11.6, {NFS}-60 a myeloid leukemia, {MC}/9 a mast cell line and mitogen activated splenic T cells. When used in combination with {PMS}, each of these cells generated higher formazan absorbance values with {XTT} than were observed with {MTT}. Thus the use of {XTT} in colorimetric proliferation assays offer significant advantages over {MTT}, resulting from reduced assay time and sample handling, while offering equivalent sensitivity.},

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ({NLR}) is a value obtained by dividing the absolute number of neutrophils by the absolute lymphocyte count and represents a biomarker of systemic inflammatory response. There are studies investigating {NLR} association with psychopathology. However, the relationship has been only studied in small numbers of patients with schizophrenia, which leads to conflicting results and makes the meta-analytic data difficult to interpret. The aim of this study is to perform large-scale cross-sectional analysis on the potential correlation between {NLR} and disease severity in schizophrenic patients with or without medication., Methods: This cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted in Nanjing Medical University Affiliated Brain Hospital. We identified inpatients with schizophrenia between July 12, 2018 and March 27, 2019 and collected data of {NLR}, the Clinical Global Impression Severity scale ({CGI}-S) score and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ({BPRS}) score., Results: The records of 1,144 identified patients (10.8\% drug-free patients) were analyzed. We found that {NLR} was significantly decreased in schizophrenic patients after antipsychotic administration and there was the discrepant correlation between {NLR} and psychiatric symptoms in patients with or without antipsychotic medication. The results of multivariate logistic regressions showed that {NLR} was positively associated with the severity of disease (i.e., the {CGI}-S score and the {BPRS} total score) in drug-free patients, and it was negatively associated with the {BPRS} negative symptoms (i.e., the {BPRS} negative symptoms score) in drug-therapy patients., Conclusion: The study is the first to confirm the hypothesis that {NLR} is independently associated with severe psychopathology in schizophrenia and is changed by antipsychotic administration.},

Relevant studies were identified by searching the electronic databases. Case reports were not considered. 93 papers were identified; 65 of which were studies. An open non-randomized design, comparing patients with {PNES} to patients with epilepsy is the dominant design. A working definition for {PNES} is proposed. With respect to psychological etiology, a heterogeneous set of factors have been identified. Not all factors have a similar impact, though. On the basis of this review we propose a model with several factors that may interact in both the development and prolongation of {PNES}. These factors involve psychological etiology, vulnerability, shaping, as well as triggering and prolongation factors. A necessary first step of intervention in patients with {PNES} seems to be explaining the diagnosis with care. Although the evidence for the efficacy of additional treatment strategies is limited, variants of cognitive (behavioural) therapy showed to be the preferred type of treatment for most patients. The exact choice of treatment should be based on individual differences in the underlying factors. Outcome can be measured in terms of seizure occurrence (frequency, severity), but other measures might be of greater importance for the patient. Prognosis is unclear but studies consistently report that 1/3rd to 1/4th of the patients become chronic.},

	abstract = {Pseudoseizure is an older term for events that appear to be epileptic seizures but, in fact, do not represent the manifestation of abnormal excessive synchronous cortical activity, which defines epileptic seizures. They are not a variation of epilepsy but are of psychiatric origin. Other terms used in the past include hysterical seizures, psychogenic seizures, and others. The most standard current terminology is psychogenic nonepileptic seizures ({PNES}). Some advocate other terms such as psychogenic functional spells or psychogenic nonepileptic events, spells, or attacks. These terms reinforce the idea that the events are not epileptic seizures. A retrospective review of a small number of patients over a number of years revealed that dozens of different diagnostic terms were used to describe these events. Though established in use, the term pseudoseizure and others should be regarded as jargon, and the use of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (or alternatively, spells) ({PNES}) is encouraged for clarity.  Distinguishing {PNES} from epileptic seizures may be difficult at the bedside even to experienced observers. In theory, almost any recurrent behavior may represent epileptic seizures. The evolution of epilepsy monitoring units and the ability to utilize simultaneous video and {EEG} recordings may be a key to diagnosis. Video electroencephalography (video-{EEG}) of a typical event showing the absence of epileptiform activity during the spell with a compatible history is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis. Diagnostic delay of years with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures is common.  Treatment of {PNES} may be difficult, but it is clear that anti-epileptic drugs ({AEDs}) are of no benefit. In addition to unnecessary costs and the potential side effects of {AEDs} for these patients, life-threatening side effects such as respiratory depression may occur if psychogenic nonepileptic status epilepticus is treated with large dosages of benzodiazepines.},

	abstract = {Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures ({PNES}) are a functional neurological disorder/conversion disorder subtype, which are neurobehavioral conditions at the interface of neurology and psychiatry. Significant advancements over the past decade have been made in the diagnosis, management, and neurobiological understanding of {PNES}. This article reviews published {PNES} research focusing on semiologic features that distinguish {PNES} from epileptic seizures, consensus diagnostic criteria, the intersection of {PNES} and other comorbidities, neurobiological studies, evidence-based treatment interventions, and outcome studies. Epidemiology and healthcare utilization studies highlight a continued unmet medical need in the comprehensive care of {PNES}. Consensus guidelines for diagnostic certainty are based on clinical history, semiology of witnessed typical event(s), and {EEG} findings. While certain semiologic features may aid in the diagnosis of {PNES}, the gold standard remains capturing a typical event on video electroencephalography ({EEG}) showing the absence of epileptiform activity with history and semiology consistent with {PNES}. Medical-neurologic and psychiatric comorbidities are prevalent in {PNES}; these should be assessed in diagnostic evaluations and integrated into treatment interventions and prognostic considerations. Several studies, including a pilot, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, have now demonstrated that a cognitive behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy is an efficacious treatment for {PNES}, and additional efforts are necessary to evaluate the utility of pharmacologic and other psychotherapy treatments. Neuroimaging studies, while requiring replication, suggest that {PNES} may occur in the context of alterations within and across sensorimotor, emotion regulation/processing, cognitive control, and multimodal integration brain systems. Future research could investigate similarities and differences between {PNES} and other somatic symptom disorders.},

With an incidence rate of 3.19 per 100,000 persons in the United States and a median age of 64 years, it is uncommon in children. The incidence is 1.6 times higher in males compared to females and 2.0 times higher in Caucasians compared to Africans and Afro-Americans, with lower incidence in Asians and American Indians. {GBM} is commonly located in the supratentorial region (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes) and is rarely located in cerebellum. Genetic and environmental factors have been investigated in {GBM}. Risk factors include prior radiotherapy, decreased susceptibility to allergy, immune factors and immune genes, as well as some single nucleotide polymorphisms detected by genomic analysis. Use of anti-inflammatory medication has been found to be protective against {GBM}. Survival from {GBM} is poor; only few patients survive 2.5 years and less than 5\% of patients survive 5 years following diagnosis. Survival rates for patients with {GBM} have shown no notable improvement in population statistics in the last three decades. Molecular epidemiology integrates molecular technology into epidemiological studies and outcomes. The future of the epidemiology of {GBM} will depend on multicenter studies generating large clinical data sets of genomic data potentially leading to further understanding of the roles of genes and environment in the development of this devastating disease.},

We describe a patient who survived more than five years from the initial diagnosis. A 44-year-old woman presented to the emergency room for evaluation one day after a motor vehicle collision at the insistence of her husband, with four weeks of confusion, behavioral changes, and increased fatigue. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) of the brain revealed an enhancing, heterogeneous mass with significant necrosis, centered in the septum pellucidum and corpus callosum with intraventricular extension. She underwent a stereotactic biopsy of the lesion. Pathology was consistent with glioblastoma, {WHO} grade {IV}. She underwent standard radiation treatment and adjuvant temozolomide, demonstrating a near-complete disappearance of the tumor on imaging for the subsequent two years. Upon recurrence, she underwent additional chemotherapy with limited response. A repeat biopsy was positive for a {BRAF} mutation and she was treated with lomustine. After two cycles, she developed thrombocytopenia and shortly after elected to discontinue treatment. She succumbed to the progression of disease five years and two months after the initial presentation. {bGBMs} are uncommon and highly aggressive brain tumors. A tailored treatment protocol may improve survival. This case marks an unusually long survival of a patient with {bGBM} and may prompt further research to better understand the behavior of these tumors and how to improve treatment response and survival.},

Several factors affect the mechanism of seizures in brain tumours, including tumour type, tumour location, and peritumoral and genetic changes. Prophylactic use of antiepileptic drugs is not recommended, and potential interactions between antiepileptic and chemotherapeutic agents persuades against the use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs. Multidrug-resistance proteins prevent the access of antiepileptic drugs into brain parenchyma, which partly explains why seizures are frequently refractory to treatment. Lamotrigine, valproic acid, and topiramate are first-line treatments of choice; if insufficient, add-on treatment with levetiracetam or gabapentin can be recommended. On the basis of clinical studies, we prefer to start treatment with valproic acid, adding levetiracetam if necessary. Risks of cognitive side-effects with antiepileptic drugs can add to previous damage by surgery or radiotherapy, and therefore appropriate choice and dose of antiepileptic drug is crucial.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The available information on postictal semiology and behavior in patients with psychogenic nonepileptic seizure ({PNES}) is limited. In this study, we explore the differences in postictal semiology and behavior between patients with epileptic seizure ({ES}) and {PNES} and focus on clinical features that may be helpful in differentiating these two conditions.
{METHODS}: In this retrospective study, video-electroencephalograph (video-{EEG}) of 144 seizures from 64 patients with {PNES} and 66 seizures from 42 patients with {ES} were reviewed. Three novel postictal behaviors were compared between the two groups: a) abrupt, brief, and rapid blinking or shaking of the head as if regaining sensorium or "coming out" of the ictal event; b) looking around the room with a scanning and uncertain look; c) posing a question of "what happened?" or a similar question to the others present in the room. In addition, differences in several other postictal characteristics were studied.
{RESULTS}: At least one of the three specific postictal behaviors was seen in 20.1\% of patients with {PNES} but none of the patients with {ES} resulting in 100\% specificity and 36\% sensitivity. While mean ictal duration was significantly longer in patients with {PNES} (175.3 ± 168 s) compared to {ES} (105.4 ± 102.9 s), the interval between the end of ictal episode and first correct verbal response (74.5 ± 126.2 s versus 139.4 ± 185.4 s), or first followed command (84.1 ± 133.8 s versus 141.1 ± 192.1 s) were shorter. In the group with {PNES}, 59.7\% of patients demonstrated a whispering or altered voice during the first correct verbal response versus 21.2\% of patients in the group with {ES}. The first followed command was slow or erroneous in 49.3\% of the patients with {PNES} and in 19.7\% of the patients with {ES}.
{CONCLUSION}: In this study, we found significant differences between postictal semiology and behavior of patients with {PNES} and {ES} that can be helpful tools in distinguishing between these two conditions. Specifically, three novel postictal behaviors were studied and were found to have a high specificity, but low sensitivity, in distinguishing {PNES} from {ES}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Epileptic seizures ({ES}) lead to alterations in the blood laboratory values and reflect changes in different organ systems. Here, we review the diagnostic and prognostic value of various blood laboratory values within the context of epilepsy.
{METHODS}: Narrative review and literature search on {PubMed} using the term, "seizure" and various laboratory values.
{RESULTS}: Laboratory markers can help clinicians determine whether an unwitnessed event was more likely to be epileptic or non-epileptic. Prolactin testing helps differentiate {ES} from psychogenic non-epileptic seizures ({PNES}) in adults and adolescents, and is associated with high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Elevations in the creatine kinase ({CK}) levels are common after generalized tonic-clonic seizures ({GTCS}) and display high specificity and moderate sensitivity. Metabolic markers such as ammonia and lactate may have diagnostic potential for postictal blood tests. Analyzing blood postictally is important for identifying the cause of the symptomatic seizures due to endocrine, metabolic, toxic or infectious etiologies. Finally, laboratory analyses are used for identifying patients who are at risk for developing rare, threatening complications such as rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure ({ARF}) or cardiomyopathy.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Presently, no postictal laboratory values can definitively prove or rule out the diagnosis of an epileptic seizure. For seizures with unknown causes, simple blood tests can be a valuable aid for quickly defining the etiology, particularly with certain metabolic and toxic encephalopathies. For this reason, {CK}, electrolytes, creatinine, liver and renal function tests should be measured on at least one occasion. Further research is needed in order to identify new biomarkers that improve the diagnosis and prognosis of seizures and seizure-related complications.},

Those with past history of psychiatric illnesses were excluded. {VEEG}, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation were performed. Patients in Group I (07) were treated with psychotherapy, psychiatric medications and immediate withdrawal of {LEV} while, those in Group {II} (06) received psychotherapy, anxiolytics and {LEV} for initial 2 months after which it was stopped. Follow-up period was six months. There was subsidence of {PNES} on discontinuation of {LEV} in these patients.   Results Mean (±{SD}) age of patients was 25 ± 12.28 years; there were 11 (84.62\%) females. All were on antiepileptic agents which included {LEV} {\textgreater}1000 mg/day, except one. Mean dose of {LEV} was 1269.23 ± 483.71 mg/day. Three patient's scores were suggestive of depression or anxiety; one had both depression and anxiety. Eight patients had mood disorders; three had a history of emotional abuse or neglect. {PNES} subsided within 1-3 months and did not recur after withdrawal of {LEV} in any patient.   Conclusion {LEV} can induce {PNES} in susceptible populations. Awareness of this association is crucial for timely withdrawal of triggering factor and appropriate management. This will reduce inadvertent additional prescription of antiepileptic agents.},

{METHODS}: From a large, structured database of 11 919 consecutive, routine video-electroencephalograpy ({EEG}) recordings, labeled using the {SCORE} (Standardized Computer-Based Organized Reporting of {EEG}) system, we extracted and analyzed 2742 seizures. For each seizure type we determined median duration and range after removal of outliers (2.5-97.5 percentile). We used surface electromyography ({EMG}) for accurate measurement of short motor seizures.
{RESULTS}: Myoclonic seizures last {\textless}150 ms, epileptic spasms 0.4-2 s, tonic seizures 1.5-36 s, atonic seizures 0.1-12,5 s, when measured using surface {EMG}. Generalized clonic seizures last 1-24 s. Typical absence seizures are rarely longer than 30 s (2.75-26.5 s) and atypical absences last 2-100 s. In our patients, the duration of focal aware (median: 27 s; 1.25-166 s) and impaired awareness seizures (median: 42.5 s; 9.5-271 s) was shorter than reported previously in patients undergoing withdrawal of antiseizure medication. All focal seizures terminated within 10 min. Median duration of generalized tonic-clonic seizures was 79.5 s (57-102 s) and of focal-to-bilateral tonic-clonic seizures was 103.5 (77.5-237 s). All tonic-clonic seizures terminated within 5 min.
{SIGNIFICANCE}: This comprehensive list of seizure durations provides important information for characterizing seizures and diagnosing patients with epilepsy. The upper limits of seizure durations are helpful in early recognition of imminent status epilepticus.},

To identify the mediators in the apoptotic cascades after {DA} or {DA} agonist challenges we used a well-characterized model system, the rodent somatolactotroph cell line {GH}3. In these cells, we show that apoptosis induced by the {DA} agonist bromocriptine ({BC}), but not {DA}, is initiated through activation of the {JNK} pathway. However, both {DA} and {BC} activate the terminal effector caspase, caspase-3. Kinetic studies and chemical inhibitor co-incubation experiments support a role for {JNK} activation preceding caspase-9 activation in {BC} challenged cells, however, engagement of these mediators was not apparent in {DA} challenge cells. These studies suggest that apoptosis induced by {BC} or {DA} is mediated through distinct and independent pathways that converge with activation of the terminal caspase, caspase-3. These observations were further reinforced by our findings that {DA} and {BC}, in co-incubation experiments, synergistically induce apoptosis. These findings raise the possibility that drugs acting through the same pathway as {DA} may be clinically beneficial when combined with {BC}.},

The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 {RNA} and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive {IgM}-{IgD} B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.},

	abstract = {G protein-coupled dopamine receptors (D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5) mediate all of the physiological functions of the catecholaminergic neurotransmitter dopamine, ranging from voluntary movement and reward to hormonal regulation and hypertension. Pharmacological agents targeting dopaminergic neurotransmission have been clinically used in the management of several neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Huntington's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ({ADHD}1), and Tourette's syndrome. Numerous advances have occurred in understanding the general structural, biochemical, and functional properties of dopamine receptors that have led to the development of multiple pharmacologically active compounds that directly target dopamine receptors, such as antiparkinson drugs and antipsychotics. Recent progress in understanding the complex biology of dopamine receptor-related signal transduction mechanisms has revealed that, in addition to their primary action on {cAMP}-mediated signaling, dopamine receptors can act through diverse signaling mechanisms that involve alternative G protein coupling or through G protein-independent mechanisms via interactions with ion channels or proteins that are characteristically implicated in receptor desensitization, such as β-arrestins. One of the future directions in managing dopamine-related pathologic conditions may involve a transition from the approaches that directly affect receptor function to a precise targeting of postreceptor intracellular signaling modalities either directly or through ligand-biased signaling pharmacology. In this comprehensive review, we discuss dopamine receptor classification, their basic structural and genetic organization, their distribution and functions in the brain and the periphery, and their regulation and signal transduction mechanisms. In addition, we discuss the abnormalities of dopamine receptor expression, function, and signaling that are documented in human disorders and the current pharmacology and emerging trends in the development of novel therapeutic agents that act at dopamine receptors and/or on related signaling events.},

We investigated {DR} expression in human {PMN} and the ability of {DA} to affect cell migration and reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) production. Experiments were performed on cells from {HS} and from patients (Pts) with bacterial infections as well, during the acute phase and after recovery. Some experiments were also performed in mice knockout ({KO}) for the {DRD}5 gene. {PMN} from {HS} express both D1-like and D2-like {DR}, and exposure to {DA} results in inhibition of activation-induced morphological changes, migration and {ROS} production which depend on the activation of D1-like {DR}. In agreement with these findings, {DA} inhibited migration of {PMN} obtained from wild-type mice, but not from {DRD}5KO mice. In Pts with bacterial infections, during the febrile phase D1-like {DRD}5 on {PMN} were downregulated and {DA} failed to affect {PMN} migration. Both D1-like {DRD}5 expression and {DA}-induced inhibition of {PMN} migration were however restored after recovery. Dopaminergic inhibition of human {PMN} is a novel mechanism which is likely to play a key role in the regulation of innate immunity. Evidence obtained in Pts with bacterial infections provides novel clues for the therapeutic modulation of {PMN} during infectious disease.},

To validate the hypothesis that antipsychotics can prolong telomere length after oxidative stress injury, leukocytes from healthy volunteers were extracted using Ficoll-Histopaque density gradient. The mononuclear cells layer was resuspended in cell culture medium. Oxidative stress was induced with hydrogen peroxide in cultured leukocytes. Four days later, leukocytes were treated with aripiprazole, haloperidol or clozapine for 7 days. Real-time {PCR} revealed that treatments with aripiprazole and haloperidol increased the telomere length by 23\% and 20\% in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after acute oxidative stress injury. These results suggest that haloperidol and aripiprazole can reduce the damage to telomeres induced by oxidative stress.

However, they also induce debilitating extrapyramidal syndromes ({EPS}), such as Parkinsonism, in a significant minority of patients. The majority of antipsychotic drugs function as dopamine receptor antagonists in the brain while the most recent ‘third’-generation, such as aripiprazole, act as partial agonists. Despite showing good clinical efficacy, these newer agents are still associated with {EPS} in {\textasciitilde} 5 to 15\% of patients. However, it is not fully understood how these movement disorders develop. Here, we combine clinically-relevant drug concentrations with mutliscale model systems to show that aripiprazole and its primary active metabolite induce mitochondrial toxicity inducing robust declines in cellular {ATP} and viability. Aripiprazole, brexpiprazole and cariprazine were shown to directly inhibit respiratory complex I through its ubiquinone-binding channel. Importantly, all three drugs induced mitochondrial toxicity in primary embryonic mouse neurons, with greater bioenergetic inhibition in ventral midbrain neurons than forebrain neurons. Finally, chronic feeding with aripiprazole resulted in structural damage to mitochondria in the brain and thoracic muscle of adult Drosophila melanogaster consistent with locomotor dysfunction. Taken together, we show that antipsychotic drugs acting as partial dopamine receptor agonists exhibit off-target mitochondrial liabilities targeting complex I.},

Furthermore, we also evaluated the modulatory activity of the different formulations on the immunological responses in macrophages primed by various stimulators such as lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), pam3CSK, and poly(I:C) via toll-like receptor 4 ({TLR}4), {TLR}2, and {TLR}3 pathways, respectively. In liver, both {ARPGCB} and {GCB}3004 produced similar toxicity profiles. In particular, these two formulas exhibited similar phospho-protein profiling of p65/nuclear factor ({NF})-κB, c-Jun/activator protein ({AP})-1, {ERK}, {JNK}, p38, caspase 3, and bcl-2 in brain. In contrast, the patterns of these phospho-proteins were variable in other tissues. Moreover, these two formulas did not exhibit any cytotoxicity in C6 glioma cells. Finally, the two formulations at available in vivo concentrations did not block nitric oxide ({NO}) production from activated macrophage-like {RAW}264.7 cells stimulated with {LPS}, pam3CSK, or poly(I:C), nor did they alter the morphological changes of the activated macrophages. Taken together, our present work, as a comparative study of two different formulas of aripiprazole, suggests that these two formulas can be used to achieve similar functional activation of brain proteins related to cell survival and apoptosis and immunotoxicological activities of macrophages.},

Second-generation atypical antipsychotics are currently first-line drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia and are also used as augmentation strategies in treatment-resistant major depression. Furthermore, these drugs have been reported to exhibit distinct metabolic side effects and to influence inflammatory processes. In this study, we used ex vivo stimulation of primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMC}) from healthy blood donors with atypical antipsychotics olanzapine or aripiprazole to examine effects on cytokine production independent from metabolic side effects and disease status. Both olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation decreased {mRNA} levels of {IL}-1β, {IL}-6, and {TNF}-α and resulted in diminished protein concentrations of {IL}-6 and {TNF}-α in conditioned medium of stimulated {PBMC}. A multiplex approach revealed additional downregulation of {IL}-2; {MIP}-1β and {IP}-10 secretion. Similarly, olanzapine and aripiprazole stimulation of the human monocytic cell line {THP}-1 resulted in a significant decrease in expression and secretion of {IL}-1β and {TNF}-α. Our results suggest that atypical antipsychotics directly influence immune cell function and thereby highlight the importance to factor in potential side effects of drugs routinely used in treatment of schizophrenia and major depression on inflammatory processes when considering anti-inflammatory drug therapy as an additional treatment option.},

	abstract = {The neurotransmitter dopamine is a key factor in central nervous system ({CNS}) function, regulating many processes including reward, movement, and cognition. Dopamine also regulates critical functions in peripheral organs, such as blood pressure, renal activity, and intestinal motility. Beyond these functions, a growing body of evidence indicates that dopamine is an important immunoregulatory factor. Most types of immune cells express dopamine receptors and other dopaminergic proteins, and many immune cells take up, produce, store, and/or release dopamine, suggesting that dopaminergic immunomodulation is important for immune function. Targeting these pathways could be a promising avenue for the treatment of inflammation and disease, but despite increasing research in this area, data on the specific effects of dopamine on many immune cells and disease processes remain inconsistent and poorly understood. Therefore, this review integrates the current knowledge of the role of dopamine in immune cell function and inflammatory signaling across systems. We also discuss the current understanding of dopaminergic regulation of immune signaling in the {CNS} and peripheral tissues, highlighting the role of dopaminergic immunomodulation in diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, several neuropsychiatric conditions, neurologic human immunodeficiency virus, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and others. Careful consideration is given to the influence of experimental design on results, and we note a number of areas in need of further research. Overall, this review integrates our knowledge of dopaminergic immunology at the cellular, tissue, and disease level and prompts the development of therapeutics and strategies targeted toward ameliorating disease through dopaminergic regulation of immunity.
Significance Statement Canonically, dopamine is recognized as a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of movement, cognition, and reward. However, dopamine also acts as an immune modulator in the central nervous system and periphery. This review comprehensively assesses the current knowledge of dopaminergic immunomodulation and the role of dopamine in disease pathogenesis at the cellular and tissue level. This will provide broad access to this information across fields, identify areas in need of further investigation, and drive the development of dopaminergic therapeutic strategies.},

The research included 25 cases of acute schizophrenia patients, 27 cases of chronic schizophrenia patients, and 30 healthy controls. In every case, we measured the {mRNA} levels of {DRD}2 and {DAT} in {PBLs} by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (real-time {RT}-{PCR}), and we evaluated the patients’ clinical symptoms using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ({PANSS}). {DRD}2 {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} of acute schizophrenia patients, chronic schizophrenia patients, and healthy controls were 0.32±0.13, 0.37±0.19, and 0.34±0.09, respectively, and the difference was not significant. {DAT} {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} of the abovementioned groups were 0.48±0.24, 0.58±0.21 and 0.39±0.24, respectively (F = 4.330, P = 0.017), and comparisons between every group showed that {DAT} {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} of chronic schizophrenia patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls ({MS} interclass = 0.198, p = 0.005). The correlation between {DRD}2 {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} and the positive symptom points of {PANSS} in acute schizophrenia patients was significant (r = 0.443, p = 0.044). In conclusion, {DRD}2 {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} are correlated with positive symptoms in acute schizophrenia patients, and {DAT} {mRNA} levels in {PBLs} of chronic schizophrenia patients are over-expressed.},

To date, there have been no studies regarding the molecular pathological and immunotoxicological profiling of aripiprazole. Thus, in the present study, we prepared two different formulas of aripiprazole [Free base crystal of aripiprazole ({ARPGCB}) and cocrystal of aripiprazole ({GCB}3004)], and explored their effects on the patterns of survival and apoptosis-regulatory proteins under acute toxicity and cytotoxicity test conditions. Furthermore, we also evaluated the modulatory activity of the different formulations on the immunological responses in macrophages primed by various stimulators such as lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}), pam3CSK, and poly(I:C) via toll-like receptor 4 ({TLR}4), {TLR}2, and {TLR}3 pathways, respectively. In liver, both {ARPGCB} and {GCB}3004 produced similar toxicity profiles. In particular, these two formulas exhibited similar phospho-protein profiling of p65/nuclear factor ({NF})-κB, c-Jun/activator protein ({AP})-1, {ERK}, {JNK}, p38, caspase 3, and bcl-2 in brain. In contrast, the patterns of these phospho-proteins were variable in other tissues. Moreover, these two formulas did not exhibit any cytotoxicity in C6 glioma cells. Finally, the two formulations at available in vivo concentrations did not block nitric oxide ({NO}) production from activated macrophage-like {RAW}264.7 cells stimulated with {LPS}, pam3CSK, or poly(I:C), nor did they alter the morphological changes of the activated macrophages. Taken together, our present work, as a comparative study of two different formulas of aripiprazole, suggests that these two formulas can be used to achieve similar functional activation of brain proteins related to cell survival and apoptosis and immunotoxicological activities of macrophages.},

	abstract = {Clozapine is an effective antipsychotic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but can cause fatal hematopoietic toxicity as agranulocytosis. To elucidate the mechanism of hematopoietic toxicity induced by clozapine, we developed an in vitro assay system using {HL}-60 cells, and investigated the effect on hematopoiesis. {HL}-60 cells were differentiated by all-trans retinoic acid ({ATRA}) into three states according to the following hematopoietic process: undifferentiated {HL}-60 cells, those undergoing granulocytic {ATRA}-differentiation, and {ATRA}-differentiated granulocytic cells. Hematopoietic toxicity was evaluated by analyzing cell survival, cell proliferation, granulocytic differentiation, apoptosis, and necrosis. In undifferentiated {HL}-60 cells and {ATRA}-differentiated granulocytic cells, both clozapine (50 and 100{μM}) and doxorubicin (0.2{µM}) decreased the cell survival rate, but olanzapine (1–100{µM}) did not. Under granulocytic differentiation for 5days, clozapine, even at a concentration of 25{μM}, decreased survival without affecting granulocytic differentiation, increased caspase activity, and caused apoptosis rather than necrosis. Histamine H4 receptor {mRNA} was expressed in {HL}-60 cells, whereas the expression decreased under granulocytic {ATRA}-differentiation little by little. Both thioperamide, a histamine H4 receptor antagonist, and {DEVD}-{FMK}, a caspase-3 inhibitor, exerted protection against clozapine-induced survival rate reduction, but not of live cell counts. 4-Methylhistamine, a histamine H4 receptor agonist, decreased the survival rate and live cell counts, as did clozapine. {HL}-60 cells under granulocytic differentiation are vulnerable under in vitro assay conditions to hematopoietic toxicity induced by clozapine. Histamine H4 receptor is involved in the development of clozapine-induced hematopoietic toxicity through apoptosis, and may be a potential target for preventing its occurrence through granulocytic differentiation.},

	abstract = {Atypical antipsychotic drugs have revolutionized the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders. The current clinically approved atypical antipsychotic drugs are characterized by having relatively low affinities for D2-dopamine receptors and relatively high affinities for 5-{HT}2A serotonin receptors (5-{HT}, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin)). Aripiprazole ({OPC}-14597) is a novel atypical antipsychotic drug that is reported to be a high-affinity D2-dopamine receptor partial agonist. We now provide a comprehensive pharmacological profile of aripiprazole at a large number of cloned G protein-coupled receptors, transporters, and ion channels. These data reveal a number of interesting and potentially important molecular targets for which aripiprazole has affinity. Aripiprazole has highest affinity for h5-{HT}2B-, {hD}2L-, and {hD}3-dopamine receptors, but also has significant affinity (5–30 {nM}) for several other 5-{HT} receptors (5-{HT}1A, 5-{HT}2A, 5-{HT}7), as well as α1A-adrenergic and {hH}1-histamine receptors. Aripiprazole has less affinity (30–200 {nM}) for other G protein-coupled receptors, including the 5-{HT}1D, 5-{HT}2C, α1B-, α2A-, α2B-, α2C-, β1-, and β2-adrenergic, and H3-histamine receptors. Functionally, aripiprazole is an inverse agonist at 5-{HT}2B receptors and displays partial agonist actions at 5-{HT}2A, 5-{HT}2C, D3, and D4 receptors. Interestingly, we also discovered that the functional actions of aripiprazole at cloned human D2-dopamine receptors are cell-type selective, and that a range of actions (eg agonism, partial agonism, antagonism) at cloned D2-dopamine receptors are possible depending upon the cell type and function examined. This mixture of functional actions at D2-dopamine receptors is consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Lawler et al (1999) that aripiprazole has ‘functionally selective’ actions. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that the unique actions of aripiprazole in humans are likely a combination of ‘functionally selective’ activation of D2 (and possibly D3)-dopamine receptors, coupled with important interactions with selected other biogenic amine receptors—particularly 5-{HT} receptor subtypes (5-{HT}1A, 5-{HT}2A).},

	abstract = {Dopamine ({DA})-agonist targeting of the {DA} D2 receptor (D2R) in prolactinomas is the first-line treatment choice for suppression of prolactin and induction of tumor shrinkage. Resistance to {DA} agonists seems to be related to receptor number. Using the {MMQ} and {GH}3 pituitary cell lines, that either do or do not express D2R, respectively, we explored the epigenetic profile associated with the presence or absence of D2R in these cells lines. These studies led us to explore pharmacological strategies designed to restore receptor expression and thereby potentially augment {DA} agonist-mediated apoptosis. We show in {GH}3 cells that the D2R harbors increased {CpG} island-associated methylation and enrichment for histone H3K27me3. Conversely, {MMQ} cells and normal pituitaries show enrichment for H3K9Ac and barely detectable H3K27me3. Coculture of {GH}3 cells with the demethylating agent zebularine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A was responsible for a decrease in {CpG} island methylation and enrichment for the histone H3K9Ac mark. In addition, challenge of {GH}3 cells with zebularine alone or coculture with both agents led to expression of endogenous D2R in these cells. Induced expression D2R in {GH}3 cells was associated with a significant increase in apoptosis indices to challenge with either {DA} or bromocriptine. Specificity of a receptor-mediated response was established in coincubations with specific D2R antagonist and {siRNA} approaches in {GH}3 cell and D2R expressing {MMQ} cell lines. These studies point to the potential efficacy of combined treatment with epigenetic drugs and {DA} agonists for the medical management of different pituitary tumor subtypes, resistant to conventional therapies.},

Our earlier study reported the formation of a functional heterodimer between bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R) and dopamine receptor 2 (D2R) that may modulate cell responses, dependent on intracellular signaling. Here, for the first time, we showed a cooperative effect of these receptors on the modulation of processes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in endothelial cells. Sumanirole, a specific D2R agonist, was shown to diminish the excessive production of reactive oxygen species induced by bradykinin, a proinflammatory B2R-activating peptide. This effect was accompanied by modified activities of antioxidant enzymes and increased phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, leading to enhance {NO} production. In turn, endothelial cell co-stimulation with B2R and D2R agonists inhibited the release of interleukin-6 and endothelin-1 and modulated the expression of apoptosis markers, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-{xL}, Bax, and caspase 3/7 activity. All these observations argue that the D2R agonist counteracts the pro-oxidative, pro-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic effects induced through B2R, finally markedly improving endothelial functions.},

However, the roles of dopamine D2 receptors in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury and cardiomyocyte apoptosis are unclear. Here we investigated the effects of both dopamine D2 receptors agonist (bromocriptine) and antagonist (haloperidol) on apoptosis of cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury.
Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury was simulated by incubating primarily cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in ischemic (hypoxic) buffer solution for 2 h. Thereafter, these cells were incubated for 24 h in normal culture medium.
Treatment of the cardiomyocytes with 10 μM bromocriptine significantly decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity, increased superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased malondialdehyde content in the culture medium. Bromocriptine significantly inhibited the release of cytochrome c, accumulation of [Ca2+]i, and apoptosis induced by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Bromocriptine also down-regulated the expression of caspase-3 and -9, Fas and Fas ligand, and up-regulated Bcl-2 expression. In contrast, haloperidol (10 μM) had no significant effects on the apoptosis of cultured cardiomyocytes under the aforementioned conditions.
These data suggest that activation of dopamine D2 receptors can inhibit apoptosis of cardiomyocytes encountered during ischemia/reperfusion damage through various pathways.},

In this new research, by using selective agonist of these receptors, Bromocriptine ({BR}), we attempted to activate D2-like expression and apoptotic induction in a selective cell line of {NSCLC}. In addition, the relationship of apoptotic response of human lung carcinoma cells to {BR} and D2- dopamine receptor genes is investigated. Human lung cancer ({QU}-{DB}) cells were treated by five doses of {BR} at 48 h and cell viability was determined by {MTT} assay. The gene expression pattern of D2-like dopamine receptor Genes was studied by Real Time {PCR}. Nuclear morphology of cells was monitored by {DAPI} flourescent staining then induction of {DNA} fragmentation by {BR} was shown in an agarose gel. Finally, the detection and quantification of apoptosis and its differentiation from necrosis was carried out by using Annecxin-V-Fluos Staining. In this study, it is demonstrated that {BR} inhibited the proliferation of human lung cancer cells and induced apoptosis in them. In addition, the probable relationship between D2-dopamine receptor genes expression and the development of apoptosis was found. In conclusion, {BR} is responsible for induction of apoptosis in human lung cancer cells and can be used in treatment of these tumoric cells. In addition, normal expression of D2 dopamine receptors was associated with apoptotic effect of {BR} on these cells.},

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate β cell mass and proliferation is important for the treatment of diabetes. Here, we identified domperidone ({DPD}), a dopamine D2 receptor ({DRD}2) antagonist that enhances β cell mass. Over time, islet β cell loss occurs in dissociation cultures, and this was inhibited by {DPD}. {DPD} increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of β cells through increasing intracellular {cAMP}. {DPD} prevented β cell dedifferentiation, which together highly contributed to the increased β cell mass. {DRD}2 knockdown phenocopied the effects of domperidone and increased the number of β cells. Drd2 overexpression sensitized the dopamine responsiveness of β cells and increased apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that the adenosine agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, a previously identified promoter of β cell proliferation, acted with {DPD} to increase the number of β cells. In humans, dopamine also modulates β cell mass through {DRD}2 and exerts an inhibitory effect on adenosine signaling.,

	abstract = {Background/Aims: Dopamine ({DA}) inhibits prolactin release and reduces lactotroph proliferation by activating D2 receptors. {DA} and its metabolite, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-{OHDA}), induce apoptosis in different cell types. {DA} receptors and {DA} transporter ({DAT}) were implicated in this action. Considering that estradiol sensitizes anterior pituitary cells to proapoptotic stimuli, we investigated the effect of estradiol on the apoptotic action of {DA} and 6-{OHDA} in anterior pituitary cells, and the involvement of the D2 receptor and {DAT} in the proapoptotic effect of {DA}. Methods: Viability of cultured anterior pituitary cells from ovariectomized rats was determined by {MTS} assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin-V/flow cytometry and {TUNEL}. Lactotrophs were identified by immunocytochemistry. Results: {DA} induced apoptosis of lactotrophs in an estrogen-dependent manner. In contrast, estradiol was not required to trigger the apoptotic action of 6-{OHDA}. Cabergoline, a D2 receptor agonist, induced lactotroph apoptosis, while sulpiride, a D2 receptor antagonist, blocked {DA}-induced cell death. The blockade of {DAT} by {GBR}12909 did not affect the apoptotic action of {DA}, but inhibited 6-{OHDA}-induced apoptosis. Conclusion: These data show that {DA}, through D2 receptor activation, induces apoptosis of estrogen-sensitized anterior pituitary cells, and suggest that {DA} contributes to the control of lactotroph number not only by inhibiting proliferation but also by inducing apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Some widely used antidepressants such as imipramine, clomipramine, and citalopram have been found to possess antineoplastic effects. In the present study, these compounds were found to induce apoptotic cell death in human acute myeloid leukemia {HL}-60 cells. Apoptosis induced by the antidepressants was identified by electron microscopy and conventional agarose gel electrophoresis and was quantitated by propodium iodide staining and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated {dUTP} nick end labeling ({TUNEL}) via flow cytometry. Treatment with apoptosis-inducing concentrations of the antidepressants (80 {microM} imipramine, 35 {microM} clomipramine, or 220 {microM} citalopram) caused induction of caspase-3/caspase-3-like activity, which was monitored by the cleavage of poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase ({PARP}), the loss of the 32 {kD} caspase-3 ({CPP}32) precursor, and the cleavage of the fluorescent {CPP}32-like substrate {PhiPhiLux}. Pretreatment with a potent caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl-ketone ({zVAD}-fmk) inhibited antidepressant-induced {CPP}32/{CPP}32-like activity and apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of caspase induced by the antidepressants was preceded by the hypergeneration of intracellular reactive oxygen species ({ROS}). These results suggested that the antidepressants may induce apoptosis via a caspase-3-dependent pathway, and induction of apoptosis by the antidepressants may provide a clue for the mechanism of their antineoplastic effects.},

	abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

The promyelocytic cell line {HL}-60 and its subline {PLB}-985 can be differentiated into neutrophil-like cells ({NLCs}) and have been used to study neutrophil functions including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, endocytosis, and degranulation. Compared to neutrophils derived from hematopoietic stem cells, {NLCs} serve as a cost-effective neutrophil model. {NLCs} derived from both {HL}-60 and {PLB}-985 cells have been shown to perform degranulation, an important neutrophil function. However, no study has directly compared the two lines as models for degranulation including their release of different types of mobilizable organelles. Furthermore, Nutridoma, a commercially available supplement, has recently been shown to improve the chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst abilities of {NLCs} derived from promyelocytic cells, however it is unknown whether this reagent also improves the degranulation ability of {NLCs}. Here, we show that {NLCs} derived from both {HL}-60 and {PLB}-985 cells are capable of degranulating, with each showing markers for the release of multiple types of secretory organelles, including primary granules. We also show that differentiating {HL}-60 cells using Nutridoma does not enhance their degranulation activity over {NLCs} differentiated using Dimethyl Sulfoxide ({DMSO}) plus Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-{CSF}). Finally, we show that promyelocytic cells can be genetically engineered and differentiated using these methods, to yield {NLCs} with a defect in degranulation. Our results indicate that both cell lines serve as effective models for investigating the mechanisms of neutrophil degranulation, which can advance our understanding of the roles of neutrophils in inflammation and immunity.},

Differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia {HL}‑60 cells ({dHL}‑60) have been used to study the mechanisms of {NETs} formation, as neutrophils have a short lifespan that limits their use. However, {dHL}‑60 cells are inefficient at generating {NETs} and therefore are not ideal replacements for neutrophils in studying of {NET} formation. In the present study, the optimal cell culture conditions and differentiation time that result in the most effective release of {NETs} from {dHL}‑60 cells upon stimulation were determined. {HL}‑60 cells were cultured in serum ({FBS}) or serum‑free (X‑{VIVO}) medium and differentiated using all‑trans retinoic acid ({ATRA}) or dimethyl sulfoxide ({DMSO}). {dHL}‑60 cells were stimulated with phorbol 12‑myristate 13‑acetate ({PMA}) or Ca2+ ionophore ({CI}). Cell differentiation and apoptosis, as well as the formation of reactive oxygen species ({ROS}) and citrullinated histone H3 ({citH}3) were analyzed using flow cytometry. {NETs} were visualized using fluorescence microscopy and {NET} quantification was performed using {PicoGreen}. Induction of {HL}‑60 cells for five days produced the best results in terms of differentiation markers and cell viability. Both {ATRA}‑ and {DMSO}‑induced {dHL}‑60 cells were able to release {NETs} upon {PMA} and {CI} stimulation; {dHL}‑60 cells in serum‑free medium produced more {NETs} than those in serum‑containing medium. {DMSO}‑{dHL}‑60 (X‑{VIVO}) cells were most efficient at producing {NETs} and {ROS} upon stimulation with {PMA}, while {ATRA}‑{dHL}‑60 (X‑{VIVO}) cells were most efficient at producing {NETs} and {citH}3 upon stimulation with {CI}. It was concluded that {DMSO}‑{dHL}‑60 (X‑{VIVO}) may be a model for the study of {ROS}‑high {NETosis} and {ATRA}‑{dHL}‑60 (X‑{VIVO}) may be suitable for {ROS}‑low {NETosis}.},

	abstract = {The {HL}60 cell line was established in 1977 from a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia. The cells largely resemble promyelocytes but can be induced to differentiate terminally in vitro. Some reagents cause {HL}60 cells to differentiate to granulocyte-like cells, others to monocyte/macrophage-like cells. The {HL}60 cell genome contains an amplified c-myc proto-oncogene; c-myc {mRNA} levels are correspondingly high in undifferentiated cells but decline rapidly following induction of differentiation. These features have made the {HL}60 cell line an attractive model for studies of human myeloid cell differentiation. This review summarizes the major properties of {HL}60 cells, describes some aspects of the regulation of gene expression in differentiating {HL}60 cells, including a novel interaction between transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls, and discusses the possible involvement of c-myc in proliferation and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Human leukemia–lymphoma ({LL}) cell lines represent an extremely important resource for research in a variety of fields and disciplines. As the cell lines are used as in vitro model systems in lieu of primary cell material, it is crucial that the cells in the culture flasks faithfully correspond to the purported objects of study. Obviously, proper authentication of cell line derivation and precise characterization are indispensable requirements to use as model systems. A number of studies has shown an unacceptable level of {LL} cell lines to be false. We present here the results of authenticating a comprehensively large sample (n = 550) of {LL} cell lines mainly by {DNA} fingerprinting and cytogenetic evaluation. Surprisingly, near-identical incidences (ca 15\%) of false cell lines were observed among cell lines obtained directly from original investigators (59/395: 14.9\%) and from secondary sources (23/155: 14.8\%) implying that most cross-contamination is perpetrated by originators, presumably during establishment. By comparing our data with those published, we were further able to subclassify the false cell lines as (1) virtual: cross-contaminated with and unretrievably overgrown by other cell lines during initiation, never enjoying independent existence; (2) misidentified: cross-contaminated subsequent to establishment so that an original prototype may still exist; or (3) misclassified: unwittingly established from an unintended (often normal) cell type. Prolific classic leukemia cell lines were found to account for the majority of cross-contaminations, eg {CCRF}-{CEM}, {HL}-60, {JURKAT}, K-562 and U-937. We discuss the impact of cross-contaminations on scientific research, the reluctance of scientists to address the problem, and consider possible solutions. These findings provide a rationale for mandating the procurement of reputably sourced {LL} cell lines and their regular authentication thereafter.},

	abstract = {Drug repositioning is an alternative process for drug development in cancer. Specifically, it is a strategy for the discovery of new antitumor drugs by screening previously approved clinical drugs. On the basis of this strategy, aripiprazole, an antipsychotic drug, was found to have anticancer activity. In this study, we investigated the radiosensitizing effects of aripiprazole on head and neck cancer cells at sublethal doses of ionizing radiation ({IR}) in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with aripiprazole suppressed the growth of head and neck cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as evidenced by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Intriguingly, aripiprazole significantly enhanced the sensitivity of these cells to the {IC}50 dose of {IR}. The combination of aripiprazole with {IR} synergistically increased annexin and propidium iodide double-positive and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase {dUTP} nick end labeling-positive cell populations, and induced cleaved poly({ADP}-ribose) polymerase and caspase-3 expression, indicating the induction of apoptosis in these cells. Aripiprazole and {IR}-induced apoptosis were accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species and was almost completely suppressed by the addition of the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine. Finally, aripiprazole greatly sensitized xenograft tumors to {IR} at doses that did not affect tumor growth. Taken together, these results suggest that aripiprazole could be considered a potent radiosensitizer for head and neck cancer.},

Additionally, most research to date has suggested a low incidence of {QTc} prolongation and orthostatic hypotension at therapeutic doses. Experience in the setting of intentional overdose, however, is limited. We present a case of a 27-year-old woman who intentionally ingested 330 mg of aripiprazole in a suicide attempt. Clinical effects were limited to mild sedation. Serum levels performed by the drug’s manufacturer confirmed a total level (parent drug and active metabolite) of 716 ng/{mL}, nearly six times the upper limit of accepted therapeutic levels. This suggests that aripiprazole’s therapeutic index is quite high and reinforces the drug’s known safety profile.},

	abstract = {Weight gain and metabolic abnormalities are serious side effects associated with the use of several second generation antipsychotics ({SGA}). The adipose tissue has been considered a direct {SGA} target involved in the development of these adverse effects. Recent studies, mainly using murine cells, have suggested that {SGA} increase both adipogenesis of preadipocytes and lipid accumulation in mature adipocytes. However, to date there has been little research comparing the effects of antipsychotics with different propensities to induce weight gain on human in vitro models of white adipose tissue neoformation and metabolism. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of antipsychotics either strongly associated with weight gain, such as the {SGA} clozapine and olanzapine, or not, such as the {SGA} ziprasidone and the classical antipsychotic haloperidol, on proliferation and adipocyte differentiation of human adipose-derived stem cells ({ADSCs}) and lipogenesis in human mature adipocytes. Whereas ziprasidone induced elevated levels of cell death during adipogenesis and could not be investigated further, we observed that clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol had slight stimulatory effects on the transcriptional program of {ADSCs} adipogenesis. However, the observed changes in adipocyte-specific genes were not accompanied by a significant increase in triglyceride accumulation within differentiated adipocytes. Our data also showed that these three antipsychotics displayed inhibitory effects on the proliferation rates of undifferentiated {ADSCs}. Regarding mature adipocyte metabolism, we observed that olanzapine slightly inhibited insulin-stimulated lipogenesis at the highest concentration used, and haloperidol exerted the strongest inhibitory effects on both basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that a direct and potent effect of clozapine and olanzapine on adipose tissue biology is not an important mechanism by which these {SGA} induce metabolic disturbances in humans. On the other hand, the haloperidol-mediated downregulation of the lipogenic capacity of human adipose tissue may be a possible mechanism contributing to its lower propensity to induce serious metabolic side effects.},

Overexpression of Bcl10 in cultured cells was reported to promote apoptosis, however, the mechanism of regulation of apoptosis mediated by Bcl10 has not been demonstrated. In the present study, we analysed the apoptosis signaling pathway mediated by Bcl10, focusing on phosphorylation of Bcl10 and the dynamic interaction with its binding partners during apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that Bcl10 potentially interacts with the other apoptosis regulator, {TNF} receptor associated factor-2 ({TRAF}2) and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins ({cIAPs}). The present results showed that the complex formation of these molecules was regulated by phosphorylation of Bcl10, that is, phosphorylation of Bcl10 resulted in binding of Bcl10 to {cIAPs} and the dissociation of it from {TRAF}2. Moreover, hyperphosphorylation of Bcl10 enhanced apoptosis, suggesting that changes in the binding partners of Bcl10 were correlated to the promotion of apoptosis as mediated by Bcl10. Indeed, the mutant which was deleted from the binding site of Bcl10 for {cIAPs}, could not induce apoptosis. These findings indicate that Bcl10 is a mediator of apoptosis signaling, by switching over binding to {cIAPs} from {TRAF}2 through the events of Bcl10 phosphorylation.},

The Bcl-2 family is the best characterized protein family involved in the regulation of apoptotic cell death, consisting of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members. The anti-apoptotic members of this family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-{XL}, prevent apoptosis either by sequestering proforms of death-driving cysteine proteases called caspases (a complex called the apoptosome) or by preventing the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c and {AIF} (apoptosis-inducing factor) into the cytoplasm. After entering the cytoplasm, cytochrome c and {AIF} directly activate caspases that cleave a set of cellular proteins to cause apoptotic changes. In contrast, pro-apoptotic members of this family, such as Bax and Bak, trigger the release of caspases from death antagonists via heterodimerization and also by inducing the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors into the cytoplasm via acting on mitochondrial permeability transition pore, thereby leading to caspase activation. Thus, the Bcl-2 family of proteins acts as a critical life-death decision point within the common pathway of apoptosis.},

Unlike {ROS}/{NOX}2, role of {NO}/{NOS} still remains undefined in the apoptosis of neutrophils ({PMNs}) and the present study attempts to decipher the importance of {NO}/{NOS} in the neutrophil apoptosis. Prolonged treatment of human {PMNs} or mice bone marrow derived neutrophils ({BMDN}) with {NO} led to enhanced {ROS} generation, caspase-8/caspase-3 cleavage, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and finally cellular apoptosis. {NO}-induced {ROS} generation led to caspase-8 deglutathionylation and activation, which subsequently activated mitochondrial death pathway via {BID} (Bcl-2 family protein) cleavage. {NO}-mediated augmentation of caspase-8 and {BID} cleavage was significantly prevented in {BMDN} from neutrophil cytosolic factor-1 ({NCF}-1) knockout ({KO}) mice, implying the involvement of {NOX}2 in {NO}-induced apoptosis of {PMNs}. Furthermore, {ROS}, {NO} generation and inducible nitric oxide synthase ({iNOS}) expression were enhanced in a time-dependent manner in human {PMNs} and mice {BMDN} undergoing spontaneous apoptosis. Pharmacological and genetic ablation of {iNOS} in human {PMNs} and mice {BMDN} significantly reduced the levels of apoptosis. Impaired apoptosis of {BMDN} from {iNOS} {KO} mice was due to reduced caspase-8 activity which subsequently prevented caspase-3 and -9 activation. Altogether, our results suggest a crucial role of {NO}/{iNOS} in neutrophil apoptosis via enhanced {ROS} generation and caspase-8 mediated activation of mitochondrial death pathway.},

This facilitates hemostasis and modulates the inflammatory response.Methods:Infarct size, heart function, and inflammatory cell composition were analyzed in mouse models of myocardial reperfusion injury with genetic and pharmacological depletion of platelet serotonin. These studies were complemented by in vitro serotonin stimulation assays of platelets and leukocytes in mice and men, and by measuring plasma serotonin levels and leukocyte activation in patients with acute coronary syndrome.Results:Platelet-derived serotonin induced neutrophil degranulation with release of myeloperoxidase and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and increased expression of membrane-bound leukocyte adhesion molecule {CD}11b, leading to enhanced inflammation in the infarct area and reduced myocardial salvage. In patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome, plasmatic serotonin levels correlated with {CD}11b expression on neutrophils and myeloperoxidase plasma levels. Long-term serotonin reuptake inhibition—reported to protect patients with depression from cardiovascular events—resulted in the depletion of platelet serotonin stores in mice. These mice displayed a reduction in neutrophil degranulation and preserved cardiac function. In line, patients with depression using serotonin reuptake inhibition, presented with suppressed levels of {CD}11b surface expression on neutrophils and lower myeloperoxidase levels in blood.Conclusions:Taken together, we identify serotonin as a potent therapeutic target in neutrophil-dependent thromboinflammation during myocardial reperfusion injury.},

Serotonin releases Weibel-Palade bodies ({WPBs}) and we asked whether absence of platelet serotonin affects neutrophil recruitment in inflammatory responses. Tryptophan hydroxylase (Tph)1–deficient mice, lacking non-neuronal serotonin, showed mild leukocytosis compared with wild-type ({WT}), primarily driven by an elevated neutrophil count. Despite this, 50\% fewer leukocytes rolled on unstimulated mesenteric venous endothelium of Tph1(-/-) mice. The velocity of rolling leukocytes was higher in Tph1(-/-) mice, indicating fewer selectin-mediated interactions with endothelium. Stimulation of endothelium with histamine, a secretagogue of {WPBs}, or injection of serotonin normalized the rolling in Tph1(-/-) mice. Diminished rolling in Tph1(-/-) mice resulted in reduced firm adhesion of leukocytes after lipopolysaccharide treatment. Blocking platelet serotonin uptake with fluoxetine in {WT} mice reduced serum serotonin by {\textgreater} 80\% and similarly reduced leukocyte rolling and adhesion. Four hours after inflammatory stimulation, neutrophil extravasation into lung, peritoneum, and skin wounds was reduced in Tph1(-/-) mice, whereas in vitro neutrophil chemotaxis was independent of serotonin. Survival of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock was improved in Tph1(-/-) mice.

Although currently used chemotherapy is capable of initially reducing the tumor burden producing a complete remission, most patients will ultimately relapse and will succumb to their disease. As such, new therapeutic strategies are needed. {AML} cells differentially expressed serotonin receptor type 1 ({HTR}1) compared with healthy blood cells and the most primitive hematopoietic fraction; in fact, {HTR}1B expression on {AML} patient samples correlated with clinical outcome. Inhibition of {HTR}1s activated the apoptosis program, induced differentiation and reduced the clonogenic capacity, while minimal effect was observed on healthy blood cells. In vivo regeneration capacity of primary {AML} samples was disrupted upon inhibition of {HTR}1. The self-renewal capacity remaining in {AML} cells upon in vivo treatment was severely reduced as demonstrated by serial transplantation. Thus, treatment with {HTR}1 antagonists showed antileukemia effect, especially anti-{LSC} activity while sparing healthy blood cells. Our results highlight the importance of {HTR}1 in leukemogenesis and {LSC} survival and identify this receptor family as a new target for therapy in {AML} with prognostic value.},

Herein, we characterized efficacies of apomorphine, bromocriptine, cabergoline, lisuride, piribedil, pergolide, roxindole, and terguride at human (h)5-{HT}(1A), h5-{HT}(1B), and h5-{HT}(1D) receptors [guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]{GTPgammaS}) binding], and at h5-{HT}(2A), h5-{HT}(2B), and h5-{HT}(2C) receptors (depletion of membrane-bound [(3)H]phosphatydilinositol). All drugs stimulated h5-{HT}(1A) receptors with efficacies (compared with 5-{HT}, 100\%) ranging from modest (apomorphine, 35\%) to high (cabergoline, 93\%). At h5-{HT}(1B) receptors, efficacies varied from mild (terguride, 37\%) to marked (cabergoline, 102\%) and potencies were modest ({pEC}(50) values of 5.8-7.6): h5-{HT}(1D) sites were activated with a similar range of efficacies and greater potency (7.1-8.5). Piribedil and apomorphine were inactive at h5-{HT}(1B) and h5-{HT}(1D) receptors. At h5-{HT}(2A) receptors, terguride, lisuride, bromocriptine, cabergoline, and pergolide displayed potent (7.6-8.8) agonist properties (49-103\%), whereas apomorphine and roxindole were antagonists and piribedil was inactive. Only pergolide (113\%/8.2) and cabergoline (123\%/8.6) displayed pronounced agonist properties at h5-{HT}(2B) receptors. At 5-{HT}(2C) receptors, lisuride, bromocriptine, pergolide, and cabergoline were efficacious (75-96\%) agonists, apomorphine and terguride were antagonists, and piribedil was inactive. {MDL}100,907 and {SB}242,084, selective antagonists at 5-{HT}(2A) and 5-{HT}(2C) receptors, respectively, abolished these actions of pergolide, cabergoline, and bromocriptine. In conclusion, antiparkinson agents display markedly different patterns of agonist and antagonist properties at multiple 5-{HT} receptor subtypes. Although all show modest (agonist) activity at 5-{HT}(1A) sites, their contrasting actions at 5-{HT}(2A) and 5-{HT}(2C) sites may be of particular significance to their functional profiles in vivo.},

	abstract = {Atypical antipsychotics ({AAPs}) are a class of drug used to treat several mental diseases like bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. However, these substances are also known to cause a rare, yet severe and sometimes fatal syndrome known as neutropenia. Neutropenia (and its more acute form, agranulocytosis) is characterized by a significant decrease in an individual's circulating neutrophils--the most abundant white blood cell. Neutrophils are essential for proper innate immunity, and depletion can result in higher risk of developing life-threatening illnesses. How atypical antipsychotics induce neutropenia is not well-understood, though research is ongoing. In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of four {AAPs}--clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and aripiprazole--on {PLB}-985 cell viability, as assessed by the {XTT} Cell Viability Assay. We found that only aripiprazole is able to significantly decrease {dPLB}-985 cell viability after 48-hour treatment. We hypothesized that aripiprazole's negative effect on cell viability is through its unique mechanism of action as a partial dopamine agonist; however, our results suggest that aripiprazole's effects are independent of dopamine receptor agonism.},

	abstract = {Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic with several advantages over conventional antipsychotics, in addition to its well-known efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. However, the high risk of agranulocytosis associated with clozapine therapy limits its clinical application. Clozapine bioactivation to an unstable protein-reactive metabolite, identified as a nitrenium intermediate, has been implicated in cytotoxicity toward neutrophils. Clozapine affects myeloid precursor cells rather than neutrophils; however, the impact of its reactive metabolite on myeloid precursor cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation remains unclear. Herein, we used hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate the reactive metabolite and compared reactive metabolite-induced cytotoxicity between {HL}-60 cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation and differentiated {HL}-60 cells. In addition, we examined the role of oxidative stress in this type of cytotoxicity. The reactive metabolite of clozapine induced rapid cytotoxicity in {HL}-60 cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation, but not in differentiated {HL}-60 cells, with the metabolite exhibiting more potent cytotoxicity than clozapine. No cytotoxicity was observed following incubation with olanzapine, a structural analog of clozapine, even after exposure of the drug to H2O2. The reactive metabolite of clozapine decreased the levels of reduced glutathione, while addition of reduced glutathione attenuated the reactive metabolite-induced cytotoxicity. These findings indicate that glutathione metabolism plays a role in the hematopoietic toxicity induced by the reactive metabolite of clozapine. Oxidative stress may potentially increase susceptibility to the hematopoietic toxicity induced by the reactive metabolite of clozapine.},

	abstract = {Expression of c-Myc sensitizes cells to a wide range of pro-apoptotic stimuli. We here show that this pro-apoptotic effect is mediated through release of mitochondrial holocytochrome c into the cytosol. First, activation of c-Myc triggers release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. This release is caspase-independent and blocked by the survival factor {IGF}-1. Second, c-Myc-induced apoptosis is blocked by microinjection of anticytochrome c antibody. In addition, we show that microinjection of holocytochrome c mimics the effect of c-Myc activation, sensitizing cells to {DNA} damage and to the {CD}95 pathway. Both p53 and {CD}95/Fas signaling have been implicated in c-Myc-induced apoptosis but neither was required for c-Myc-induced cytochrome c release. Nonetheless, inhibition of {CD}95 signaling in fibroblasts did prevent c-Myc-induced apoptosis, apparently by obstructing the ability of cytosolic cytochrome c to activate caspases. We conclude that c-Myc promotes apoptosis by causing the release of cytochrome c, but the ability of cytochrome c to activate apoptosis is critically dependent upon other signals.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women globally. The existing treatment options for breast cancer are largely associated with severe toxicities, and lower efficacies. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of non-toxic effective drugs against breast cancer. For this purpose, drug repositioning strategy was used to evaluate the anti-cancer potential of a library of heterocyclic drugs. The major advantage of drug repurposing is that the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicity profiles of drugs are well documented. In the current study, we screened 97 drugs of different chemical classes, and among them aripiprazole, an antipsychotic drug, was found to be sufficiently active against breast cancer cell line {MCF}-7. Aripiprazole showed a cytotoxicity ({IC}50 = 12.1 ± 0.40 μM) to {MCF}-7 cells, comparable to the standard anticancer drug doxorubicin ({IC}50 = 1.25 ± 0.34 μM). Aripiprazole was also found to be active against other cancer cell lines, including {MDA}-{MB}-231 ({IC}50 = 19.83 ± 0.27 μM), {AU}565 ({IC}50 = 18.02 ± 0.44 μM), and {BT}-474 ({IC}50 = 36.42 ± 0.12 μM). Aripiprazole significantly inhibited the cell cycle progression at {subG}0G1 phase, and enhanced apoptosis in {MCF}-7 breast cancer cells. The drug was also able to significantly increase the nuclear condensation, and modulated the expression of certain genes involved in breast cancer, such as caspases 3, and 9, {BAK}-1, C-{MYC}, {BCL}2L1, {BCL}-10, and {BCL}-2. Further studies are needed to explore the effect of aripiprazole on intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Dopamine partial agonism and functional selectivity have been innovative strategies in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and mood disorders and have shifted the concept of dopamine modulation beyond the established approach of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonism. Despite the fact that aripiprazole was introduced in therapy more than 12 years ago, many questions are still unresolved regarding the complexity of the effects of this agent on signal transduction and intracellular pathways, in part linked to its pleiotropic receptor profile. The complexity of the mechanism of action has progressively shifted the conceptualization of this agent from partial agonism to functional selectivity. From the induction of early genes to modulation of scaffolding proteins and activation of transcription factors, aripiprazole has been shown to affect multiple cellular pathways and several cortical and subcortical neurotransmitter circuitries. Growing evidence shows that, beyond the consequences of D2R occupancy, aripiprazole has a unique neurobiology among available antipsychotics. The effect of chronic administration of aripiprazole on D2R affinity state and number has been especially highlighted, with relevant translational implications for long-term treatment of psychosis. The hypothesized effects of aripiprazole on cell-protective mechanisms and neurite growth, as well as the differential effects on intracellular pathways [i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinase ({ERK})] compared with full D2R antagonists, suggest further exploration of these targets by novel and future biased ligand compounds. This review aims to recapitulate the main neurobiological effects of aripiprazole and discuss the potential implications for upcoming improvements in schizophrenia therapy based on dopamine modulation beyond D2R antagonism.},

	abstract = {Background
The Opportunity Atlas project is a pioneering effort to trace social mobility and adulthood socioeconomic outcomes back to childhood residence. Half of the variation in adulthood socioeconomic outcomes was explainable by neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics during childhood. Clustering census tracts by Opportunity Atlas characteristics would allow for further exploration of variance in social mobility. Our objectives here are to identify and describe spatial clustering trends within Opportunity Atlas outcomes.
Methods
We utilized a k-means clustering machine learning approach with four outcome variables (individual income, incarceration rate, employment, and percent of residents living in a neighborhood with low levels of poverty) each given at five parental income levels (1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles of the national distribution) to create clusters of census tracts across the contiguous United States ({US}) and within each Environmental Protection Agency region.
Results
At the national level, the algorithm identified seven distinct clusters; the highest opportunity clusters occurred in the Northern Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest opportunity clusters occurred in rural areas of the Southwest and Southeast. For regional analyses, we identified between five to nine clusters within each region. {PCA} loadings fluctuate across parental income levels; income and low poverty neighborhood residence explain a substantial amount of variance across all variables, but there are differences in contributions across parental income levels for many components.
Conclusions
Using data from the Opportunity Atlas, we have taken four social mobility opportunity outcome variables each stratified at five parental income levels and created nationwide and {EPA} region-specific clusters that group together census tracts with similar opportunity profiles. The development of clusters that can serve as a combined index of social mobility opportunity is an important contribution of this work, and this in turn can be employed in future investigations of factors associated with children's social mobility.},

This study carried out multivariate statistical analyses on compositional (i.e., element concentration) data from till samples to recognize areas that likely contain lithium pegmatite mineralization in the Västernorrland region, central Sweden. We applied principal components analysis ({PCA}) and K-means clustering techniques to reveal regional-scale patterns in the till geochemical data. We demonstrate that these two methods have potential for recognition of geochemical anomalies related to the underlying bedrock geology as well as to mineralization. The results of {PCA}- and K-means clustering were validated using known occurrences of lithium mineralization. Two different datasets were compared; one containing all available geochemical data and the second containing only available trace elements in the dataset and it was found that anomalous clusters of samples defined by K-means clustering have anomalous multi-element signatures defined by robust {PCA}. This demonstrated that principal components are the continuous solutions to the discrete cluster members for the K-means clustering. The results show that both {PCA} and K-means clustering of till geochemical datasets at the early stages of exploration and target generation may reveal useful information that can be used to identify potential areas for more detailed mapping or exploration activities.},

	abstract = {Background
{DNA} microarrays, which determine the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes from a sample, are an important research tool. However, the volume of data they produce can be an obstacle to interpretation of the results. Clustering the genes on the basis of similarity of their expression profiles can simplify the data, and potentially provides an important source of biological inference, but these methods have not been tested systematically on datasets from complex human tissues. In this paper, four clustering methods, {CRC}, k-means, {ISA} and {memISA}, are used upon three brain expression datasets. The results are compared on speed, gene coverage and {GO} enrichment. The effects of combining the clusters produced by each method are also assessed.

Results
k-means outperforms the other methods, with 100\% gene coverage and {GO} enrichments only slightly exceeded by {memISA} and {ISA}. Those two methods produce greater {GO} enrichments on the datasets used, but at the cost of much lower gene coverage, fewer clusters produced, and speed. The clusters they find are largely different to those produced by k-means. Combining clusters produced by k-means and {memISA} or {ISA} leads to increased {GO} enrichment and number of clusters produced (compared to k-means alone), without negatively impacting gene coverage. {memISA} can also find potentially disease-related clusters. In two independent dorsolateral prefrontal cortex datasets, it finds three overlapping clusters that are either enriched for genes associated with schizophrenia, genes differentially expressed in schizophrenia, or both. Two of these clusters are enriched for genes of the {MAP} kinase pathway, suggesting a possible role for this pathway in the aetiology of schizophrenia.

Conclusion
Considered alone, k-means clustering is the most effective of the four methods on typical microarray brain expression datasets. However, {memISA} and {ISA} can add extra high-quality clusters to the set produced by k-means, so combining these three methods is the method of choice.},

	abstract = {Background
Research interests toward single cell analysis have greatly increased in basic, translational and clinical research areas recently, as advances in whole-transcriptome amplification technique allow scientists to get accurate sequencing result at single cell level. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to identify distinct cell groups that have different gene expression patterns. Currently there are limited bioinformatics approaches available for single-cell {RNA}-seq analysis. Many studies rely on principal component analysis ({PCA}) with arbitrary parameters to identify the genes that will be used to cluster the single cells.

Results
We have developed a novel algorithm, called {SAIC} (Single cell Analysis via Iterative Clustering), that identifies the optimal set of signature genes to separate single cells into distinct groups. Our method utilizes an iterative clustering approach to perform an exhaustive search for the best parameters within the search space, which is defined by a number of initial centers and P values. The end point is identification of a signature gene set that gives the best separation of the cell clusters. Using a simulated data set, we showed that {SAIC} can successfully identify the pre-defined signature gene sets that can correctly separated the cells into predefined clusters. We applied {SAIC} to two published single cell {RNA}-seq datasets. For both datasets, {SAIC} was able to identify a subset of signature genes that can cluster the single cells into groups that are consistent with the published results. The signature genes identified by {SAIC} resulted in better clusters of cells based on {DB} index score, and many genes also showed tissue specific expression.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient algorithm to identify the optimal subset of genes that separate single cells into distinct clusters based on their expression patterns. We have shown that it performs better than {PCA} method using published single cell {RNA}-seq datasets.

	abstract = {Background
The Opportunity Atlas project is a pioneering effort to trace social mobility and adulthood socioeconomic outcomes back to childhood residence. Half of the variation in adulthood socioeconomic outcomes was explainable by neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics during childhood. Clustering census tracts by Opportunity Atlas characteristics would allow for further exploration of variance in social mobility. Our objectives here are to identify and describe spatial clustering trends within Opportunity Atlas outcomes.
Methods
We utilized a k-means clustering machine learning approach with four outcome variables (individual income, incarceration rate, employment, and percent of residents living in a neighborhood with low levels of poverty) each given at five parental income levels (1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles of the national distribution) to create clusters of census tracts across the contiguous United States ({US}) and within each Environmental Protection Agency region.
Results
At the national level, the algorithm identified seven distinct clusters; the highest opportunity clusters occurred in the Northern Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest opportunity clusters occurred in rural areas of the Southwest and Southeast. For regional analyses, we identified between five to nine clusters within each region. {PCA} loadings fluctuate across parental income levels; income and low poverty neighborhood residence explain a substantial amount of variance across all variables, but there are differences in contributions across parental income levels for many components.
Conclusions
Using data from the Opportunity Atlas, we have taken four social mobility opportunity outcome variables each stratified at five parental income levels and created nationwide and {EPA} region-specific clusters that group together census tracts with similar opportunity profiles. The development of clusters that can serve as a combined index of social mobility opportunity is an important contribution of this work, and this in turn can be employed in future investigations of factors associated with children's social mobility.},

In this paper, we discuss some widely-used deep learning architectures and their practical applications. An up-to-date overview is provided on four deep learning architectures, namely, autoencoder, convolutional neural network, deep belief network, and restricted Boltzmann machine. Different types of deep neural networks are surveyed and recent progresses are summarized.

Similarly, exponential growth in the development of different data analysis approaches has been reported in the literature, amongst which the K-means algorithm remains the most popular and straightforward clustering algorithm. The broad applicability of the algorithm in many clustering application areas can be attributed to its implementation simplicity and low computational complexity. However, the K-means algorithm has many challenges that negatively affect its clustering performance. In the algorithm’s initialization process, users must specify the number of clusters in a given dataset apriori while the initial cluster centers are randomly selected. Furthermore, the algorithm's performance is susceptible to the selection of this initial cluster and for large datasets, determining the optimal number of clusters to start with becomes complex and is a very challenging task. Moreover, the random selection of the initial cluster centers sometimes results in minimal local convergence due to its greedy nature. A further limitation is that certain data object features are used in determining their similarity by using the Euclidean distance metric as a similarity measure, but this limits the algorithm’s robustness in detecting other cluster shapes and poses a great challenge in detecting overlapping clusters. Many research efforts have been conducted and reported in literature with regard to improving the K-means algorithm’s performance and robustness. The current work presents an overview and taxonomy of the K-means clustering algorithm and its variants. The history of the K-means, current trends, open issues and challenges, and recommended future research perspectives are also discussed.},
