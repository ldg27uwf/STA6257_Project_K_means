The Opportunity Atlas project is a pioneering effort to trace social mobility and adulthood socioeconomic outcomes back to childhood residence. Half of the variation in adulthood socioeconomic outcomes was explainable by neighborhood-level socioeconomic characteristics during childhood. Clustering census tracts by Opportunity Atlas characteristics would allow for further exploration of variance in social mobility. Our objectives here are to identify and describe spatial clustering trends within Opportunity Atlas outcomes.
Methods
We utilized a k-means clustering machine learning approach with four outcome variables (individual income, incarceration rate, employment, and percent of residents living in a neighborhood with low levels of poverty) each given at five parental income levels (1st, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 100th percentiles of the national distribution) to create clusters of census tracts across the contiguous United States ({US}) and within each Environmental Protection Agency region.
Results
At the national level, the algorithm identified seven distinct clusters; the highest opportunity clusters occurred in the Northern Midwest and Northeast, and the lowest opportunity clusters occurred in rural areas of the Southwest and Southeast. For regional analyses, we identified between five to nine clusters within each region. {PCA} loadings fluctuate across parental income levels; income and low poverty neighborhood residence explain a substantial amount of variance across all variables, but there are differences in contributions across parental income levels for many components.
Conclusions
Using data from the Opportunity Atlas, we have taken four social mobility opportunity outcome variables each stratified at five parental income levels and created nationwide and {EPA} region-specific clusters that group together census tracts with similar opportunity profiles. The development of clusters that can serve as a combined index of social mobility opportunity is an important contribution of this work, and this in turn can be employed in future investigations of factors associated with children's social mobility.},

	abstract = {Background
Research interests toward single cell analysis have greatly increased in basic, translational and clinical research areas recently, as advances in whole-transcriptome amplification technique allow scientists to get accurate sequencing result at single cell level. An important step in the single-cell transcriptome analysis is to identify distinct cell groups that have different gene expression patterns. Currently there are limited bioinformatics approaches available for single-cell {RNA}-seq analysis. Many studies rely on principal component analysis ({PCA}) with arbitrary parameters to identify the genes that will be used to cluster the single cells.

Results
We have developed a novel algorithm, called {SAIC} (Single cell Analysis via Iterative Clustering), that identifies the optimal set of signature genes to separate single cells into distinct groups. Our method utilizes an iterative clustering approach to perform an exhaustive search for the best parameters within the search space, which is defined by a number of initial centers and P values. The end point is identification of a signature gene set that gives the best separation of the cell clusters. Using a simulated data set, we showed that {SAIC} can successfully identify the pre-defined signature gene sets that can correctly separated the cells into predefined clusters. We applied {SAIC} to two published single cell {RNA}-seq datasets. For both datasets, {SAIC} was able to identify a subset of signature genes that can cluster the single cells into groups that are consistent with the published results. The signature genes identified by {SAIC} resulted in better clusters of cells based on {DB} index score, and many genes also showed tissue specific expression.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed an efficient algorithm to identify the optimal subset of genes that separate single cells into distinct clusters based on their expression patterns. We have shown that it performs better than {PCA} method using published single cell {RNA}-seq datasets.
