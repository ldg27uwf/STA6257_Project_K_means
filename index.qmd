## Objectives

The objectives of this review are threefold: to provide a comprehensive
overview of K-means clustering, to discuss its methodology,
applications, and advancements, and to identify the challenges and
future research directions. In this literature review, we aim to give an
in-depth analysis of K-means clustering, examine its various aspects and
practical uses, and highlight the current challenges along with
potential areas for future research.

## Introduction

[@zelasky_identifying_2023]

#### *K-means Clustering*

*Definition of Clustering*

Clustering is the process of grouping similar objects or data points
together based on their characteristics or attributes. Clustering is an
unsupervised learning technique employed in data mining and machine
learning to categorize a collection of items based on their similarity.
The goal is to create groupings, or clusters, where objects within the
same cluster are more alike to each other than to objects in other
clusters. Clustering aims to identify inherent clusters in a dataset
where the data points within each cluster exhibit a strong resemblance,
yet the clusters themselves are clearly dissimilar from one another.

The similarity of data points is commonly assessed using a distance
metric, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine
similarity. The choice of metric depends on the characteristics of the
data and the specific clustering technique employed.

#### ***Definition of k-Means Clustering***

The term "k-Means Clustering" refers to a method used in data analysis
and machine learning to partition a set of data points into k distinct
clusters. k-Means clustering is a highly popular and extensively
utilized approach for clustering. The objective is to divide a dataset
into k clusters, where k is a predetermined number of clusters. The
method operates in an iterative manner, assigning each data point to one
of k clusters based on the given attributes. The main concept is to
establish k centroids, representing each cluster, and allocate each data
point to the centroid that is closest to it. This allocation is done in
a way that minimizes the total squared distances between the data points
and their respective centroids.

#### ***Key Concepts of k-Means Clustering***

-   **Centroid**: The centroid of a cluster represents the average
    position of all the points within that cluster. Every cluster in the
    k-means algorithm is associated with a centroid, which serves as a
    central point that represents the cluster.

-   **Inertia:** Referred to as within-cluster sum of squares,
    quantifies the effectiveness of cluster formation. Smaller inertia
    values suggest superior clustering performance.

-   **Convergence:** The k-means method continues to iterate until it
    reaches convergence, which is when the centroids stop changing
    considerably. This indicates that the clusters have become stable.

-   **Distance Metric:** Choice of distance measure, such as Euclidean
    distance, impacts the formation of clusters. Euclidean distance is
    the typical metric employed in k-means.

#### ***Key Parameters of k-Means Clustering***

-   **Cluster Count (k):** The desired number of clusters and centroids
    to be generated. Optimal cluster selection is of utmost importance
    and can be facilitated by techniques such as the elbow approach or
    silhouette analysis.

-   **Initial Centroids:** The initial positions of the centroids, which
    can be selected randomly or using more sophisticated initialization
    methods such as k-means++ to enhance the speed of convergence and
    the quality of the solution.

-   **Maximum Iterations:** The highest number of iterations that the
    algorithm will execute if it has not achieved convergence before
    reaching this limit.

-   **Tolerance:** A criterion used to establish when convergence has
    been achieved. The algorithm terminates if the difference between
    the centroids is below the specified tolerance.

#### ***Algorithmic Steps***

The k-means clustering algorithm is an iterative procedure that involves
two steps: allocating data points to clusters and updating the cluster
centroids. Below is a comprehensive breakdown of the sequential steps in
the algorithm:

1.  **Initialization of centroids.**

Random initialization selects ùëò initial centroids at random from the
dataset. Every centroid corresponds to the original center of a cluster.
The algorithm being referred to is called "k-means++" is a refined
technique that distributes the initial centroids in order to enhance the
performance of the algorithm. The initial centroid is selected at
random, whereas the following centroids are chosen according to a
probability that is directly proportionate to their distance from the
nearest existing centroid.

2.  **Assignment of data points to nearest centroids.**

Compute the distance from each data point to every centroid. Popular
distance measurements include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance,
and cosine similarity. Allocate each data point to the cluster that has
the closest centroid to it. This results in the formation of ùëò clusters,
where each data point is assigned to a single cluster.

3.  **Update of centroids.**

Determine the updated centroid of each cluster by computing the average
of all data points assigned to that cluster. The updated centroid is
calculated as the average position of the data points within the
cluster. This update step recalibrates the position of the centroids to
more accurately reflect the clusters produced in the assignment stage.

4.  **Iteration until convergence.**

Iterate the assignment and update processes until the centroids exhibit
minimal variation between iterations. Convergence is usually assessed by
verifying if the positions of the centroids have reached a stable state
within a predetermined tolerance threshold. Alternatively, the process
can be halted after reaching a predetermined number of iterations if
convergence is not attained prior to that.

Mathematical Formulation The k-means clustering algorithm can be
analytically defined as an optimization problem. The objective is to
divide a collection of n data points into k clusters in a manner that
minimizes the sum of squares inside each cluster (WCSS). The process
entails the following steps: Objective function (minimization of
within-cluster variance). The goal of k-means is to minimize the total
sum of squared distances between each data point and its corresponding
cluster centroid. The within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) represents
this.

## Real World Applications

**Bioinformatics** refers to the usage of analytical techniques to
interpret different types of biological data. These datasets can be
large or small, containing information about genomic sequences, gene
expression, and protein expression, among other biological
characteristics. This information can then be used to draw conclusions
about basic biological processes, disease states, and gene therapies,
among other applications [@bayat_bioinformatics_2002]. K-means
clustering is one type of data analysis technique that can be used to
group differential gene/protein expression according to specific
phenotypes, or physical presentations of biological traits. For
instance, this can be used to assign cells to specific types based on
single-cell RNA sequencing data, which measures the total gene
expression for thousands of genes within a single cell. Yang et al.,
2017 utilized k-means clustering to analyze the scRNA sequencing data of
hundreds of cell types to develop a novel algorithm that identifies the
optimal sets of genes to cluster single cells into distinct biological
groups.

Additionally, k-means clustering can be applied to population-level data
to determine significant groupings related to **socioeconomic
outcomes**. The factors related to socioeconomic mobility were evaluated
in a 2023 study using longitudinal data from the Opportunity Atlas
project. Here, k-means clustering revealed differences in socioeconomic
mobility related to geographic location, income, and neighborhood
factors such as poverty rate and incarceration rates
